Janamejaya was curious to know the story of the Kuru clan of kings, especially his immediate predecessors from Vysampayana. Daksha Prajāpati was the mānasa putra of Lord Brahma (son born out of Brahma’s vision). His son was Aditi and his son was Vivasvata (Lord Surya). Manu was the son of Surya. Manu’s son was Ila and his son was Purūrava. Nahusha was the grandson of Purūrava, and Nahusha’s son was Yayāthi. [^1]

### Background of the Story
 Yayāti swapped his untimely old age with his youngest son Pururava and ruled the country for thousands of years. In the later part of his life, he realized the futility of worldly enjoyments and enthroned his son Pururava. Pururava was one of the illustrious Shatchakravarthis (six great emperors) and he was the progenitor of Kuru clan of kings. Prathisravasa or Pratipa was in the lineage of Pururava.

### The Story
Once upon a time there lived an Ikshvaku dynasty king by name Mahābhiṣha. By virtue of performing thousands of Yagas, he attained heaven. One day Mahābhiṣha set forth to Brahmaa Loka along with Devendra for offering prayers to Lord Brahma. There were scores of Gods standing before the feet of Brahmaa. There came the celestial Ganga to offer prayers to Lord Brahmaa. She was very beautiful and her grace enchanted Mahābhiṣha. A whiff of air suddenly lifted her veil over her body, and all Gods except Mahābhiṣha bent their heads. Mahābhiṣha’s eyes were glued to the disrobed Ganga, and the **Lord Brahmaa observed the uncanny and shameless act of Mahābhiṣha.** He immediately cursed him that he would born again upon the earth; and the celestial Ganga, though marrying Mahābhiṣha, would act against his wishes.

What can Mahābhiṣha do when he was cursed by Lord Brahmaa and all odds are up against him. With the help of Gods, he could identify that the king Pratipa was pious among all the kings, and Mahābhiṣha decided to born to him. The river Ganga also left the place with thoughts revolving around Mahābhiṣha who had lost his equilibrium in the court of Lord Brahmaa.

On her way to the Earth, she saw Ashta Vasūs (they are the personifications of Pancha Mahā bhūtās (महा भूतास्) -, and the Sun, the Moon and a Nakshatra [^2]). She was surprised to find the insipid and gloomy demeanor of Vasūs who were otherwise resplendent and glorious. They were destined to be born upon the earth. **On knowing that the river Ganga is going to marry a human being upon the earth, they wanted to born in her womb.** They said, ‘Oh Mother Ganga! Give birth to all of us, and help us in our salvation. We do not want born to a normal human lady’. Ganga was inquisitive to know their story.

### Vasishta’s curse to Vasūs
When the river Ganga and Mahābhiṣha’s incident happened in the court of Brahmaa, an interesting event unfolded in the life of Ashta Vasūs elsewhere upon the earth. On the foothills of Meru, there lived the sage Vasisishta, one of the Sapta Rishis [^3]. He was having a wonder cow (the cow was born to Kashyapa and Surabhi, the daughter of Daksha Prajapati) which could fulfill any desire of any person at its will.

One day Asta Vasūs visited the Ashram of Vasishta and the sage was not there at that time. The wife of Prabhas (one of the Asta Vasūs) was attracted very much by the cow and she wanted to have it, and eventually she wanted it gift it to her friend, Jitavati, a daughter of Usinara king. Prabhas was overwhelmed by her request and he wanted to steal it when the Rishi was not there in the Ashram. All other Vasūs could not say no to their request.

Vasishta came bake to his Ashram by evening and he could not find his cow. With his ‘divya drishti’ he could see how it was stolen. **Asta Vasūs were Gods, and Gods cannot behave like mundane people.** So, he cursed them to be born upon earth. The Ashta Vasūs ran towards the Ashram and fell on the feet of Vasishta and begged pardon.

Vasishta said, ‘My curse cannot be reversed, but I allow a concession. Except Prabhas, the main culprit, all other seven Vasūs shall die immediately upon birth and redeem their sin. But, Prabhas shall remain upon the earth with long lasting longevity and remain celibate’.

Ganga heard the story with deep sigh and agreed to bear them in her womb. The Vasūs said, ‘Oh Mother! You throw all of us in waters immediately after our birth and help us in redeeming our sins. We do not want to remain upon the earth for long’. Ganga agreed, but with condition. **‘I shall throw seven of you into the waters, and give back the eighth son to the king. This shall be in accordance to dharma and also in tune with Vasishta’s words’.** The Vasūs agreed to bestow one eighth of their resplendence each to the surviving eighth boy and went away.

### Birth of Mahābhiṣha upon earth as Santana
Pratipa, the king of Kuru clan was performing japam for a number of years on the banks of the river Ganga. One day while he was in deep meditation, a beautiful young lady came up to him and sat on his right thigh. Pratipa opened his eyes and surprised to see a sanguine lady sitting on his lap. He asked, ‘Oh Kalyanee! Why have you sat on my thigh? How can I help you?’. The lady said, ‘Oh Great king! I have come to seek your hand and you may accept me as your wife’.

The king smiled and said, ‘I cannot love an unknown lady; and also, cannot accept anyone other than a Kshatriya. This is my vratam. Further, by sitting on my right thigh, you have already relinquished your claim unknowingly. **Right thigh of a man belongs to his daughter and daughter-in-law. Left thigh is for wife and the lover**. I suggest that you can marry my son and become my daughter-in-law’.

Ganga agreed and said, ‘Oh king! I am impressed by your dharmic talk. I will serve the Bharat clan by marrying your son. But I have a condition. **I shall marry your son and stay with him as long as he accepts my actions. The day he denounces my action; I will leave him’.** The king agreed her condition and came back to his kingdom.

For the king, who should be his daughter-in-law was decided upon; but where is the son? He started performing tapas for the sake of a son. His tapas got fructified and his wife became pregnant, and in due course of time, gave birth to a boy. He was none other than Mahābhiṣha in his previous birth. His name was christened as Sāntanu, who later came to be known as Santhanu. We come to know Sāntanu and his marriage with Ganga and the eventual birth of Bhishma in our next episode.

 

### Points to Ponder
1. In ancient times, as far as possible, the names are given as per the features and traits of the child. Sāntanu is one such. ((उपरतस्य वंशस्य सन्तानः शान्तन्य; विस्तारः इति शान्ततनुः – (उपरतस्य वंशस्य सन्तानः शान्तन्य; विस्तारः इति शान्ततनुः -). It means the one who expands the family lineage which has become stopped. We find such other meaningful names and meaningful epithets for many other names. We shall discuss them as and when such characters appear in Maha Bharata.
2. Right side of the man’s body belongs to daughter or daughter-in-law; and left side belongs to the wife. This is more a tradition than a dharmic reason. In ardha nārīśvara image of Lord Shiva, we find the female part of the Sakti is on the left side. In spiritual traditions left is often associated with the feminine energy. It represents the receptive, intuitive, and nurturing qualities, which are typically attributed to the goddess or Shakti. In the story, when Ganga sat on the right side of Pratipa, she had by default, relinquished her claim to be his wife.
	One more example of this nature is sporting uttareeyam (a shawl) on the shoulders by traditional practitioners of Sanatana dharma. If the wife is surviving it is sported on the left shoulder; and if he survived her death, he had to sport it on the right shoulder.
	
	Traditions of this nature are abundant and are being practiced down the ages, making India that is Bharath a cultural continuum where each generation pass them on into next generation.
3. Pancha Mahā bhūtās (महा भूतास्): God is the Creator, Protector and Destroyer of the Universe which is made up of Pancha Mahā bhūtā They are Prithvi (earth - Bhūdevi), Aap (Water – Varun Dev), Tejas (Fire - Agni Dev), Vayu (Air - Vayu Dev), and Akash or sky (Infinity). They possess certain Gunas or traits which are as follows:
	a. Prithvi - sabda, sparsa, rupa, rasa and Gandha
	b. Aap - sabda, sparsa, rupa, and rasa. Gandha or smell is absent.
	c. Tejas - sabda, sparsa, and rupa. Here ‘rasa’ or taste is absent.
	d. Vayu - sabda, and sparsa. Here the trait- rupa or image is also absent.
	e. Akash - Only sabda trait is there and not even sparsa or feeling of touch.

	Thus, each is subtler by other and thus each has emanated from other until we find the least subtle Mahā bhūta which is Prithvi or Earth. Thus, the origination of Srishti is described as **‘ākāśāt vāyuḥ, vāyor agniḥ, agner āpaḥ, adbhyah pṛthivī’** etc. From Akash there emerged Vayu; from Vayu, Agni emerged; from Agni, water emerged; from Water, the Earth emerged; from the Earth, there came out plants, and annam; and from those the human emerged in the universe. Thus, the ‘unity’ unfolds into ‘variety’.

	In the story, five of eight Vasūs are Pancha Mahā bhūtās (five elements of nature from which all humans and living creatures are made of).

4. Why did Vasishta curse all the eight Vasūs when the crime was committed by one person, Prabhas? In Sanatana Dharma, the principle that rules the roost it is:
	**कर्ता कारयिता चैव प्रेरकश्चानुमोदकः ।**
	**सुकृते दुष्कृते चैव चत्वारः समभागिनः ॥**
	
	kartā kārayitā caiva prerakaścānumodakaḥ ।
	sukṛte duṣkṛte caiva catvāraḥ samabhāginaḥ ॥
	
	(It means – the doer, the one who gets it done, the stimulator and the follower - be it a misdeed or a meritorious deed, all four of them have an equal share in sin or merit). In the story, the other Vasūs are accomplices in the act of crime, and hence, all are punishable.

	Incidentally, the Criminal Law, the principle is the chief actor or perpetrator of a crime; those who aid, abet, counsel, command, or induce the commission of a crime may also be principals. All are responsible for the criminal act.

### Questions
1. India that is Bharath is a cultural continuum. List out a few traditional practices which have sustained thousands of generations.
2. Write a note on Pancha Mahā bhūtā
3. What is your name and what is its meaning? Do you possess the qualities embedded in your name?
4. Do you know the lineage of Pandavas and Kauravas? Do they belong to Chandra Vamsa or Surya Vamsa?
5. In the background of Sanatana Dharma, who are held punishable for each act of a crime?
