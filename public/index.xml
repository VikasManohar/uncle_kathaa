&lt;p&gt;Bhishma, one of the most revered and powerful characters of the Mahabharata, was not born an ordinary human. His birth was divine and rooted in a celestial curse. Once, the eight Vasus-celestial beings - were cursed by Sage Vashishta for stealing his divine cow. As a result, they were fated to be born on earth. To escape prolonged earthly life, they sought Ganga Devi’s help. &lt;strong&gt;She agreed to be their mother and liberate them from their curse soon after birth.&lt;/strong&gt; Meanwhile, Mahābhiṣha, a noble king of Ikshvaku dynasty, was born to Pratip Chakravarti of Kuru clan. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Janamejaya was curious to know the story of the Kuru clan of kings, especially his immediate predecessors from Vysampayana. Daksha Prajāpati was the mānasa putra of Lord Brahma (son born out of Brahma’s vision). His son was Aditi and his son was Vivasvata (Lord Surya). Manu was the son of Surya. Manu’s son was Ila and his son was Purūrava. Nahusha was the grandson of Purūrava, and Nahusha’s son was Yayāthi. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Story 20 - The Great Fall of Yayāti - Heaven (Swarga) vis-à-vis Moksha (Liberation)</title>
      <link>https://example.org/posts/story20/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of Yayāti is very interesting in Mahabharata. It answers many questions- what are heaven and hell and how is heaven (Swarga) different from Liberation (Moksha); and why do the texts of Hinduism talk about Swargam when it is impermanent?  Let us read and understand the story&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-of-the-story&#34;&gt;Background of the Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yayāti was the son of emperor Nahusha, a famous mythological character of ancient India.  We know from the previous episodes that Yayāti swapped his untimely old age with his youngest son Pururava and ruled the country for thousands of years. While he was a king, he performed innumerable Yagnas and amassed enormous amounts of merit (punya) that he was destined by Providence to spend thousands of years in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-of-the-story&#34;&gt;Background of the Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kshatriya king Yayāti married Devayani, a Brahmin on the orders of Sukracharya and Sukracharya exonerated the sin of Varna Sankara attaching to the king. Sukracharya cautioned Yayāti that he should not marry Sarmishta, the daughter of king Vrushaparva who accompanied Devayani as her Dasi (servant). &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yayāti came back from the hermitage of Sukracharya and started ruling the country with Mahendrapuram as his capital. When Devayani attained puberty, she was blessed with a son.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Story revolves around three important issues - the anger and its management, the true essence of Pāṇigrahaṇa, and finally वर्ण सांकर्यं (Varṇa sāṃkaryaṃ) and its nuances as per Sastras. Apart from this the story talks of the clash of two ego-centric characters. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devayani was the daughter of Sukrācārya, the family guru of daityas (also called Asuras or Demons). At that time, the king of Asuras was Vrushaparva and he had a daughter by name Sarmishta.  Devayani and Sarmishta were friends and on one day they went out for a forest accompanied by a huge number of servant maids and care takers. After roaming for a while they entered a pond of water, and they were swimming with joy. It so happened that a gush wind from the bushes galvanized the area where the ladies had dropped their robes, and all the robes got mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Vysampayana was narrating the story of Kacha &amp;amp; Devayani in the court of the king Janamejaya. Incidentally he said that no rishi would marry Devayani.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;King Janamejaya heard the story of Samrat Bharata from Vysampayana and he was delighted to know the origin of Bharata Khanda. Now he was inquisitive to know the story of Kuru Vamsa from Vysampayana, and he started narrating the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daksha prajāpati (hereinafter wards mentioned as Daksha) was the mānasa putra (born out of the manas) of Brahmaa. He was the progenitor of the entire world, and to procreate the species, he married several wives. It is said that all the twenty-seven stars (nakshatras) who later married the Moon God, Chandra were his daughters. Parvati, the wife of Lord Siva was his daughter. His two daughters Adithi and Dithi were married to Kasyapa. Through Adithi and Dithi he got all the Gods and Asuras as his sons. Through Vinata and Kadru he got Garutmantha and all the serpents respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The story of Sakuntala and king Dushyantha is a very popular story of Maha Bharata. The intellectual genius of women in ancient India, the brilliance of argumentative power, the superb negotiating skills are at once displayed for readers to understand many sociological and psychological issues of Indian society. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Eighteen Akshouhinis of warriors were destroyed in the Kurukshetra war fought between Pandavas and Kauravas. Such a destruction was planned much in advance in the court of Brahmaa to rid the Earth free from Adharmic forces. The story relies on the passages from Mahabharata and some Puranas to unravel the plan and the eventual birth of Gods and Asuras upon the earth. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-of-the-story&#34;&gt;Background of the Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the advice of sage Vedavyasa, Vysampayana started narrating the story of Mahabharata in the court of Janamejaya. Janamejaya heard the story of Vedavyasa and asked as to why his forefathers indulged in a brutal war. Vysampayana started narrating the births chief warriors and the reasons for their birth upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The story heralds the birth of Vedavyasa who has written this great episode ‘Mahabharata’. Mahabharata is also known as Panchama Veda (the fifth Veda) since it discusses the nuances of Vedic dictums in easy and logical way for the sake of common populace. The stories of Mahabharata are illustrations to the great Vedic thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story discusses Yashti Pravesam &lt;strong&gt;tradition&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;which has been followed for many years in India&lt;/strong&gt; by the kings at the time of coronation. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Garutmantha or Garuda is the trusted devotee and the vehicle of Lord Vishnu.

&lt;p&gt;Deva-Asura sangrama or the war between the gods and demons is a very popular story that we come across in many Puranas and Itihasas. The story is the subject matter of many folk songs, ballads and of late, films. The churning of the ocean and resultant war appeals to all types of readers from children to highly learned intellectuals. The symbolism behind the story is for the consumption of intellectuals and the story, per se, is for children. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The effects of anger and jealousy are the subject matter of this story. Anger results in delusion and fails the intellect of any person. The story discusses dāsī system (slavery) prevalent in ancient societies and tries to compare this system that was prevalent in Bharath vis-à-vis the West. The prevalence of the practice of preserving eggs in ghee pots for incubation is an ingenuous scientific technique unique to Indian society; and this aspect is also covered in the current story. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a famous story from Mahabharatha (Adi Parva), the verses of which are quoted very often by scholastic community to distinguish a satvic and rajasic personalities. Anger management is the hallmark of satva personality. This story also talks of the importance of devotion that is given in certain nitya/ naimittika karmas by our scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mahabharata, as we know, was recited first by Vaiśaṃpāyana in the court of Janamejaya. Ugrasravasa, son of a sūta was present in the court and he had understood the entire story. He wanted to narrate the story in greater detail to greater congregations, and so, he reached the illustrious Naimisaranya where he found more than ten thousand rishis who were the disciples of Saunaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugrasravasa was very pious and humble, and he expressed his intentions to the rishis. &lt;strong&gt;The rishis were eager to listen to Mahabharata, but Saunaka wanted to hear the story of Bhrigu vamsa from Ugrasravasa before listening to Mahabharat.&lt;/strong&gt; Ugrasravasa obliged to the request of Vaiśaṃpāyana, and he started narrating the story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Gurukul education was a prominent system in ancient Bharat (India) and it was there till the nineteenth century when the Macaulay Minute was formulated in 1835. The story under consideration revolves around Gurukul education &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; prevalent in Mahabharat times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there lived a rishi, Ayodha Dhaumya in an āśrama surrounded by a thick forest. Upamanyu, Aruni &amp;amp; Veda were his three disciples. It was Gurukul system of learning, and all the students were learning language, grammar, mathematics, Vedic texts, Itihasas and a whole lot of yoga, pranayama, and meditation techniques under the benevolent patronage of the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;vedavyasa-mahabharatam--the-story-the-ethics-morals--the-traditions&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Vedavyasa Mahabharatam – the story, the ethics, morals &amp;amp; the traditions)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interestingly, the first and the last story of Mahabharata is that of a dog. The king of Hastinapura, Janamejaya (Arjuna’s son is Parikshit and his son is Janamejaya) was performing a &lt;strong&gt;satra yāgaṃ&lt;/strong&gt; assisted by his three brothers- Sruthasena, Ugrasena and Bhimasena. Satra yāgaṃ was supposed to &lt;strong&gt;benefit the humanity&lt;/strong&gt; at large and the king was interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saunaka Maharshi was a kulapati (currently, the word is loosely translated as the Chancellor of a University) and he was having more than ten thousand students in his āśramaṃ at Naimiśāraṇya. Once upon a time, Saunaka Maharshi was performing Satrayāga in the vicinity of his āśramaṃ with the help of all his disciples.
