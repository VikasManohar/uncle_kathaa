[{"content":"Background of the Story Bhishma, one of the most revered and powerful characters of the Mahabharata, was not born an ordinary human. His birth was divine and rooted in a celestial curse. Once, the eight Vasus-celestial beings - were cursed by Sage Vashishta for stealing his divine cow. As a result, they were fated to be born on earth. To escape prolonged earthly life, they sought Ganga Devi’s help. She agreed to be their mother and liberate them from their curse soon after birth. Meanwhile, Mahābhiṣha, a noble king of Ikshvaku dynasty, was born to Pratip Chakravarti of Kuru clan. 1\nThe Story At that time, King Santanu, the noble ruler of Hastinapura, was captivated by the radiant beauty of Ganga while walking along the Ganga River. Enchanted, he proposed marriage. Ganga remembered her promise to the eight Vasus and agreed for the marriage, but on one condition: the king should never question her actions, no matter how strange they might seem. Santanu, deeply in love, consented.\nGanga bore him eight children - each one a Vasu in human form. However, soon after giving birth, she would take the child and drown it in the river. Though pained, the king kept his word and remained silent. But when the eighth child was born, Santanu, unable to bear it any longer, stopped her. Ganga, reminding him of the promise, revealed her identity as celestial Ganga and the truth - that these children were celestial beings and she was freeing them from their curse.\nHowever, because Santanu stopped her before she could drown the last child, the eighth Vasu - Prabhas also known as Dyau - would live a long life on earth. This child would be the greatest among men - brilliant, wise, and invincible in war. Ganga took the child away, named him Devavrata, and raised him in the heavenly realms under the guidance of great sages like Devavrata and Devavrata, and martial training from Parashurama, the great warrior-sage.\nYears later, when Devavrata had grown into a mighty and learned prince, Ganga returned him to Santanu.\nDevavrata’s Noble Qualities and Life at Hastinapura Devavrata quickly won the hearts of the people of Hastinapura. He was a paragon of dharma, wisdom, strength, and compassion. Santanu was overjoyed to see his son grow into an ideal prince - worthy of ruling the kingdom.\nThe people, too, looked upon Devavrata as the perfect heir to the Kuru dynasty. He was coronated as the Yuvaraja, or crown prince. Everything seemed perfect.\nBut fate had other plans.\nSantanu’s Love and Devavrata’s Search for a Bride One day, while hunting along the banks of the Yamuna, King Santanu was struck by the divine fragrance in the air. Following its trail, he came upon a beautiful maiden - Satyavathi, the foster daughter of a fisherman chieftain named Dasaraju (or Dasha Raja, also called Matsya Raja). Satyavathi was also called Matsyagandhi, as she originally had a fish-like odour, later replaced by divine fragrance due to a boon from Sage Parashara (for understanding the Satyavathi story, please see my previous episode- “Story 13 – Birth of Vedavyasa”.\nSantanu was smitten by her and approached Dasaraju to ask for Satyavati’s hand in marriage. The fisherman was respectful but firm. He said he would give Satyavati only if her future son could become king. Santanu was shocked - for this meant bypassing his beloved son Devavrata, who had already been declared heir.\nBound by dharma and fatherly love, Santanu could not break his word to Devavrata. Nor could he marry Satyavathi under these conditions. Saddened, he returned to the palace, but his grief was visible. Devavrata noticed his father’s sorrow and sought to know the reason.\nHow can a father tell his love towards a lady to his own? After great persuasion, he said: ‘You are my only son and you are certainly equal to hundred sons in valour and wisdom. Yet, if any peril occurs to you, our family lineage gets broken.\nअनपत्यतैकपुत्रत्वं इत्याहुर्धर्मवादिनः I\nचक्षुरेकं च पुत्रश्च अस्ति नास्ति च भारत II\nचक्षुर्नाशे तनॊर्नाश: पुत्रनाशे कुलक्षयः II 2 – Adi Parvam 100.67\n(Having one son is as good of no sons- say the dharmic people. One son or one eye – are as as good as no son or no eye. The body withers away if the one eye withers out; and if the one son is lost, the lineage gets stuck.)\nDevavrata thought for a while and with all wisdom approached an old Minister of his father. The later confided the real intentions of Santanu with Devavrata. Devavrata realised that his father had fallen in love with some lady. He summoned the charioteer of his father and came to know that his father’s desire is hooked to a fisher-man’s daughter.\nDevavrata’s Visit to Dasaraju and The Terrible Vow With a noble purpose, Devavrata went to Dasaraju’s court and formally requested Satyavati’s hand for his father. Dasaraju said, ‘Yes! I am prepared to give my daughter in marriage with Santanu but I have a condition. My daughter’s son should be the future king of Hastinapur. I put forth this condition since my foster daughter, Satyavati has the celestial lineage and her father is a great samrat and her mother is an apsarasa’.\nDevavrata has no problem. He vowed in the presence of all kings present in the court that he would abide by the condition and that he would make Satyavati’s son as the future king of Hastinapur.\nThe fisherman, though honoured, was reluctant. “You are noble,” he said, “but what of your sons? Will they not stake a claim to the throne?”\nUnderstanding the depth of the concern, Devavrata made an earth-shaking decision. He vowed before all present:\n“I will renounce my right to the throne. I shall never marry. I will remain a Brahmachari (celibate) for life, so that no progeny of mine will ever challenge Satyavati’s children.” परित्यजाम्यहं राज्यं मैथुनञ्चापि सर्वशः I ऊर्ध्वरेता भविष्यामि दाश सत्यं ब्रवीमि ते II 3 – Adi parvam 100.97 (I hereby forsake the kingdom and also any sexual activity. Oh Dasaraj! I remain URDHVA RETASK – keep the retas or semen upwards. I am telling this truth and abide by it’)\nThe heavens trembled. The Gods showered flowers upon him. The sages declared: “Bhishma! Bhishma!” - meaning “the one who took the terrible vow.” This was the moment he became Bhishma.\nDasaraju, moved beyond words, agreed to the alliance. King Santanu, upon learning of his son’s vow, was overwhelmed. As a token of gratitude, he granted Bhishma the boon of Iccha-Mrityu - the ability to choose the time of his death.\nFrom then on, Bhishma became the pillar of the Kuru dynasty. Though he renounced the throne, he ruled wisely as regent and guardian of the dynasty across generations - from Vichitravirya to Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and even the Pandavas and Kauravas.\nPoints to ponder The Ideal of Sacrifice and Dharma: Bhishma’s story, especially his early life and vow, is one of the most powerful expressions of sacrifice, dharma, and loyalty in all of Indian epic literature. “न कर्मणा न प्रजया धनेन त्यागेनैके अमृतत्वमानशुः”4 – thus says Narayanopanishad. It means one cannot attain Moksham (Amrutatvam) by means of karmas like Yagna, Yaga, Vratam or by wealth or by possessing progeny. By virtue of sacrifice one can attain divinity.\nIn this story Devavrata gave up personal biological happiness and even the kingdom for the sake of his father. His pratigna stands unmatched in history and myth alike.\nBhishma’s character is quite relevant even after five thousand years as we witness the sons capturing throne by imprisoning or even killing their parents. Ajatasatru of 5th century BC, Ashoka of 3rd century BC, Allauddin Khilji of 13th century and the like are examples of this trend. The entire Mughal history in India is filled with patricide and acrimony among brothers.\nThe saying “Having one son is no son; and having one eye is as good as no eyes” is a popular proverb rooted in traditional Hindu wisdom and social attitudes. While it reflects folk philosophy and pragmatic concerns, it is not explicitly found as a direct quote in primary śāstra (scriptural) sources such as the Vedas, Smritis, or Puranas. However, the sentiment expressed does echo some ideas found in dharmaśāstra, Itihāsa-Purāṇas, and classical Sanskrit literature, where sons were seen as essential for continuing the lineage and performing ancestral rites, and having only one son was seen as precarious. Likewise, the comparison to one eye refers to the vulnerability and lack of depth (literally and metaphorically).\nWhat is Urdhva Retas? The Sanskrit phrase “Urdhva Retas” can be translated into English as:\n“One whose seed flows upwards” or “One who has sublimated or transformed his sexual energy upward.”\nUrdhva (ऊर्ध्व): upward, elevated, higher; and Retas (रेतस्): seed, seminal fluid, reproductive energy etc.\nPhilosophical/Spiritual Meaning:\nIn yogic and spiritual contexts, an Urdhva Retas is a person - usually a yogi, sage, or celibate - who has:\nTranscended or conserved sexual energy (brahmacharya). Redirected that energy toward spiritual awakening, higher consciousness, or kundalini shakti. Practiced inner alchemy or tapas to maintain mental and spiritual purity. It is often used as a title or description of high-level sages like Patanjali, Shuka Maharshi, or even Bhishma, who were believed to have mastered their senses and transmuted physical energy into spiritual strength.\nIchha-Mrutyu: इच्छा मृत्यु) - It means death at will or self-willed death - is a rare and elevated idea, and while it’s most fully developed in Hindu thought, parallels or reflections of it do exist in other ancient cultures, though often in different theological or philosophical forms. In Hinduism, Icchā-Mṛtyu or Svachhanda-Maraṇa is found only to very elevated beings, rishis or yogis who have complete mastery over body, prana (life force), and karma. The best examples are Bhishma, Hanuman, Markandeya etc.\nIn Christian hagiography, some saints and ascetics are said to have:\nPredicted the time of their death Prepared themselves through prayer and “peacefully given up the ghost” (e.g., St. Francis of Assisi, and many desert fathers). This is not, of course same as svachhanda maranam, but has elements of dying consciously. In Buddhist tradition Buddha is said to have consciously chosen the time and place of his Parinirvana.\nQuestions Trace out a few characters from Itihasas and Puranas who have excelled in tyagam (sacrifice). What life lessons we learn from the early life of Devavrata (Bhishma)? Why a son is considered important in ancient Indian spiritual thought?

Daksha Prajāpati was the mānasa putra of Lord Brahma (son born out of Brahma’s vision). His son was Aditi and his son was Vivasvata (Lord Surya). Manu was the son of Surya. Manu’s son was Ila and his son was Purūrava. Nahusha was the grandson of Purūrava, and Nahusha’s son was Yayāthi. 1\nBackground of the Story Yayāti swapped his untimely old age with his youngest son Pururava and ruled the country for thousands of years. In the later part of his life, he realized the futility of worldly enjoyments and enthroned his son Pururava. Pururava was one of the illustrious Shatchakravarthis (six great emperors) and he was the progenitor of Kuru clan of kings. Prathisravasa or Pratipa was in the lineage of Pururava.\nThe Story Once upon a time there lived an Ikshvaku dynasty king by name Mahābhiṣha. By virtue of performing thousands of Yagas, he attained heaven. One day Mahābhiṣha set forth to Brahmaa Loka along with Devendra for offering prayers to Lord Brahma. There were scores of Gods standing before the feet of Brahmaa. There came the celestial Ganga to offer prayers to Lord Brahmaa. She was very beautiful and her grace enchanted Mahābhiṣha. A whiff of air suddenly lifted her veil over her body, and all Gods except Mahābhiṣha bent their heads. Mahābhiṣha’s eyes were glued to the disrobed Ganga, and the Lord Brahmaa observed the uncanny and shameless act of Mahābhiṣha. He immediately cursed him that he would born again upon the earth; and the celestial Ganga, though marrying Mahābhiṣha, would act against his wishes.\nWhat can Mahābhiṣha do when he was cursed by Lord Brahmaa and all odds are up against him. With the help of Gods, he could identify that the king Pratipa was pious among all the kings, and Mahābhiṣha decided to born to him. The river Ganga also left the place with thoughts revolving around Mahābhiṣha who had lost his equilibrium in the court of Lord Brahmaa.\nOn her way to the Earth, she saw Ashta Vasūs (they are the personifications of Pancha Mahā bhūtās (महा भूतास्) -, and the Sun, the Moon and a Nakshatra 2). She was surprised to find the insipid and gloomy demeanor of Vasūs who were otherwise resplendent and glorious. They were destined to be born upon the earth. On knowing that the river Ganga is going to marry a human being upon the earth, they wanted to born in her womb. They said, ‘Oh Mother Ganga! Give birth to all of us, and help us in our salvation. We do not want born to a normal human lady’. Ganga was inquisitive to know their story.\nVasishta’s curse to Vasūs When the river Ganga and Mahābhiṣha’s incident happened in the court of Brahmaa, an interesting event unfolded in the life of Ashta Vasūs elsewhere upon the earth. On the foothills of Meru, there lived the sage Vasisishta, one of the Sapta Rishis 3. He was having a wonder cow (the cow was born to Kashyapa and Surabhi, the daughter of Daksha Prajapati) which could fulfill any desire of any person at its will.\nOne day Asta Vasūs visited the Ashram of Vasishta and the sage was not there at that time. The wife of Prabhas (one of the Asta Vasūs) was attracted very much by the cow and she wanted to have it, and eventually she wanted it gift it to her friend, Jitavati, a daughter of Usinara king. Prabhas was overwhelmed by her request and he wanted to steal it when the Rishi was not there in the Ashram. All other Vasūs could not say no to their request.\nVasishta came bake to his Ashram by evening and he could not find his cow. With his ‘divya drishti’ he could see how it was stolen. Asta Vasūs were Gods, and Gods cannot behave like mundane people. So, he cursed them to be born upon earth. The Ashta Vasūs ran towards the Ashram and fell on the feet of Vasishta and begged pardon.\nVasishta said, ‘My curse cannot be reversed, but I allow a concession. Except Prabhas, the main culprit, all other seven Vasūs shall die immediately upon birth and redeem their sin. But, Prabhas shall remain upon the earth with long lasting longevity and remain celibate’.\nGanga heard the story with deep sigh and agreed to bear them in her womb. The Vasūs said, ‘Oh Mother! You throw all of us in waters immediately after our birth and help us in redeeming our sins. We do not want to remain upon the earth for long’. Ganga agreed, but with condition. ‘I shall throw seven of you into the waters, and give back the eighth son to the king. This shall be in accordance to dharma and also in tune with Vasishta’s words’. The Vasūs agreed to bestow one eighth of their resplendence each to the surviving eighth boy and went away.\nBirth of Mahābhiṣha upon earth as Santana Pratipa, the king of Kuru clan was performing japam for a number of years on the banks of the river Ganga. One day while he was in deep meditation, a beautiful young lady came up to him and sat on his right thigh. Pratipa opened his eyes and surprised to see a sanguine lady sitting on his lap. He asked, ‘Oh Kalyanee! Why have you sat on my thigh? How can I help you?’. The lady said, ‘Oh Great king! I have come to seek your hand and you may accept me as your wife’.\nThe king smiled and said, ‘I cannot love an unknown lady; and also, cannot accept anyone other than a Kshatriya. This is my vratam. Further, by sitting on my right thigh, you have already relinquished your claim unknowingly. Right thigh of a man belongs to his daughter and daughter-in-law. Left thigh is for wife and the lover. I suggest that you can marry my son and become my daughter-in-law’.\nGanga agreed and said, ‘Oh king! I am impressed by your dharmic talk. I will serve the Bharat clan by marrying your son. But I have a condition. I shall marry your son and stay with him as long as he accepts my actions. The day he denounces my action; I will leave him’. The king agreed her condition and came back to his kingdom.\nFor the king, who should be his daughter-in-law was decided upon; but where is the son? He started performing tapas for the sake of a son. His tapas got fructified and his wife became pregnant, and in due course of time, gave birth to a boy. He was none other than Mahābhiṣha in his previous birth. His name was christened as Sāntanu, who later came to be known as Santhanu. We come to know Sāntanu and his marriage with Ganga and the eventual birth of Bhishma in our next episode.\nPoints to Ponder In ancient times, as far as possible, the names are given as per the features and traits of the child. Sāntanu is one such. ((उपरतस्य वंशस्य सन्तानः शान्तन्य; विस्तारः इति शान्ततनुः – (उपरतस्य वंशस्य सन्तानः शान्तन्य; विस्तारः इति शान्ततनुः -). It means the one who expands the family lineage which has become stopped. We find such other meaningful names and meaningful epithets for many other names. We shall discuss them as and when such characters appear in Maha Bharata.\nRight side of the man’s body belongs to daughter or daughter-in-law; and left side belongs to the wife. This is more a tradition than a dharmic reason. In ardha nārīśvara image of Lord Shiva, we find the female part of the Sakti is on the left side. In spiritual traditions left is often associated with the feminine energy. It represents the receptive, intuitive, and nurturing qualities, which are typically attributed to the goddess or Shakti. In the story, when Ganga sat on the right side of Pratipa, she had by default, relinquished her claim to be his wife. One more example of this nature is sporting uttareeyam (a shawl) on the shoulders by traditional practitioners of Sanatana dharma. If the wife is surviving it is sported on the left shoulder; and if he survived her death, he had to sport it on the right shoulder.\nTraditions of this nature are abundant and are being practiced down the ages, making India that is Bharath a cultural continuum where each generation pass them on into next generation.\nPancha Mahā bhūtās (महा भूतास्): God is the Creator, Protector and Destroyer of the Universe which is made up of Pancha Mahā bhūtā They are Prithvi (earth - Bhūdevi), Aap (Water – Varun Dev), Tejas (Fire - Agni Dev), Vayu (Air - Vayu Dev), and Akash or sky (Infinity). They possess certain Gunas or traits which are as follows: a. Prithvi - sabda, sparsa, rupa, rasa and Gandha b. Aap - sabda, sparsa, rupa, and rasa. Gandha or smell is absent. c. Tejas - sabda, sparsa, and rupa. Here ‘rasa’ or taste is absent. d. Vayu - sabda, and sparsa. Here the trait- rupa or image is also absent. e. Akash - Only sabda trait is there and not even sparsa or feeling of touch.\nThus, each is subtler by other and thus each has emanated from other until we find the least subtle Mahā bhūta which is Prithvi or Earth. Thus, the origination of Srishti is described as ‘ākāśāt vāyuḥ, vāyor agniḥ, agner āpaḥ, adbhyah pṛthivī’ etc. From Akash there emerged Vayu; from Vayu, Agni emerged; from Agni, water emerged; from Water, the Earth emerged; from the Earth, there came out plants, and annam; and from those the human emerged in the universe. Thus, the ‘unity’ unfolds into ‘variety’.\nIn the story, five of eight Vasūs are Pancha Mahā bhūtās (five elements of nature from which all humans and living creatures are made of).\nWhy did Vasishta curse all the eight Vasūs when the crime was committed by one person, Prabhas? In Sanatana Dharma, the principle that rules the roost it is: कर्ता कारयिता चैव प्रेरकश्चानुमोदकः । सुकृते दुष्कृते चैव चत्वारः समभागिनः ॥\nkartā kārayitā caiva prerakaścānumodakaḥ । sukṛte duṣkṛte caiva catvāraḥ samabhāginaḥ ॥\n(It means – the doer, the one who gets it done, the stimulator and the follower - be it a misdeed or a meritorious deed, all four of them have an equal share in sin or merit). In the story, the other Vasūs are accomplices in the act of crime, and hence, all are punishable.\nIncidentally, the Criminal Law, the principle is the chief actor or perpetrator of a crime; those who aid, abet, counsel, command, or induce the commission of a crime may also be principals. All are responsible for the criminal act.\nQuestions India that is Bharath is a cultural continuum. List out a few traditional practices which have sustained thousands of generations. Write a note on Pancha Mahā bhūtā What is your name and what is its meaning? Do you possess the qualities embedded in your name? Do you know the lineage of Pandavas and Kauravas? Do they belong to Chandra Vamsa or Surya Vamsa? In the background of Sanatana Dharma, who are held punishable for each act of a crime? This story is from Adi Parva of Maha Bharata written by sage Ved Vyasa.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Ashta Vasus (Eight Vasus) are a group of eight deities associated with elemental forces in Hindu mythology.

It answers many questions- what are heaven and hell and how is heaven (Swarga) different from Liberation (Moksha); and why do the texts of Hinduism talk about Swargam when it is impermanent? Let us read and understand the story1.\nBackground of the Story Yayāti was the son of emperor Nahusha, a famous mythological character of ancient India. We know from the previous episodes that Yayāti swapped his untimely old age with his youngest son Pururava and ruled the country for thousands of years. While he was a king, he performed innumerable Yagnas and amassed enormous amounts of merit (punya) that he was destined by Providence to spend thousands of years in heaven.\nThe Story By virtue of his meritorious deeds Yayāti entered Amaravati, the celestial city of Indra. Since his Punyam (merit) was as high as that of Indra, he was revered and respected by the Gods and other celestial beings. He spent thousands of years in heaven, there afterwards Prajapati loka, and then in Bramha loka (the abode of Brahma) and freely moved with the bevy of beauties in the form of Apsaras.\nOne day Lord Indra approached Yayāti and said, ‘Hi Yayāti! You have been in heaven for thousands of years. Is there any other person upon the earth who equals with your meritorious acts? Yayāti replied,\nनाऽहं देव मनुष्येषु गन्धर्वेषु महर्षिषु। आत्मनस्तपता तुल्यं कञ्चित्पश्यामि वासव! II 2– Adi Parva 88.2\n(‘My Dear Indra, I have not seen anybody so far among humans, gods, gandharvas or rishis who is as powerful as I am in the matters of tapas and austerity)\nIndra said coolly, ‘Oh, you have rejected the greatness of your equals, your superiors and your subordinates without knowing their merits. Hence your accumulated merit has dried out from your account, and you are destined to fall upon the earth’.\nYayāti realized that his fall was due to his ego. He accepted the imminent fate and requested Indra to place him in the company of good people (सतां मध्ये पतितुं देवराज -satāṃ madhye patituṃ devarāja). Indra respected the words of Yayāti.\nAshtaka, a rishi saw Yayāti falling upon the earth where Ashtaka and his associates used to conduct Yagnas. He was awestruck by the spiritual aura of Yayāti and enquired as to who he was and as to why he was falling upon earth. Yayāti was happy that he had fallen to a place resided by good people. He narrated his entire story (see our previous two stories) and how his merits were wiped out by demeaning the tapas of others.\nज्ञातिः सुहृत्स्वजनो वा यथेह क्षीणे वित्ते त्यजते मानवैर्हिI तथा तत्र क्षीण पुण्यं मनुष्यं त्यजन्ति सद्यः सेश्वरा देव सङ्घा:II 3 – Adi Parva 90.2.\n‘Just as the friends, the kith and kin leave a person once his money is drained out, so also, the Gods disown a person once his merits get exhausted’.\nYayāti continued, ‘the persons who tell great about their own meritorious deeds will never qualify to reach heaven. Instead, they fall into Bhauma Naraka (hell connected with the earth). Ashtaka was anxious to know as to what kind of deeds lead to heaven or hell.\nHow can one attain Heaven? Yayāti began telling,\nतपश्च दानं च समो दमश्च ह्रीरार्जवं सर्वभूतानुकम्पाI स्वर्गस्य लोकस्य वदन्ति सन्तः द्वाराणि सप्तैव महान्ति पुंसाम्II नश्यन्ति मानेव तमोऽभिभूताः पुंसः सदैवेति वदन्ति संतःII 4 – Adi Parva 90.22\n(‘Penance (तपस्), charity (दानं), calmness of mind induced by renunciation of desires (शम), control of external senses (दम), modesty (ह्री:), truthfulness (आर्जवम्), and kindness to all creatures (दया) are the sevenfold steps that lead a person to heaven’)\n(Here the idea is that one should have these qualities to become eligible for heaven. If you drop down the idea of eating a sweet, it is sama- शम (control of mind). If you do not allow your feet to move to restaurant to purchase a sweet, it is dama - दम (control of sense organs).\n‘Once you attain merit and reach heaven, you should continue in the path of modesty and dwell in the deep thoughts of Vedas and scriptures’. ‘One should discard ego and boastfulness which surely lead a person to hell. Yagnas are not for publicity but for purity of thoughts and actions. Once a person realizes this he is above the concepts of heaven and hell and merges with the Ultimate Truth (परमात्मा) where he attains liberation from births and deaths.\nआस्येव तु यदाहारं गोवन्मृगयते मुनि:I अथास्य लोकः सर्वोsयं सोsमृतत्वाय कल्पतेII 5 – Adi Parva, 91.18 (‘One who takes food like a cow- with mouth and without using arms (it symbolically means that the one who does not accumulate wealth for generations), for him the earth itself is the place for attaining liberation’, Yayāti concluded.\nAnalysis of the Story We know from our scriptures that each action (कर्म) has a result- good or bad depending upon the nature of the act and intention of the act. If the act is meritorious and for the good of the people and society at large (लोक संग्रह), it results in accumulation of Punya (merit). Again, if the act is done without an iota of self-interest and without anticipating the fruit of the action (कर्म संन्यास), the person is above the concepts of merit/ de merit; and he is a Liberated Soul.\nThe story of Yayāti is an interesting episode in Maha Bharata. The etymological meaning of ‘Yayāti’ is ‘yasya vāyoriva yātiḥ sarvatra rathagatiryasya’ (यस्य वायोरिव याति सर्वत्र रथगतिर्यस्य सः ययाति) - the person who wanders everywhere with the speed of Vayu- the wind God and with the speed of a chariot is Yayāti . Here we see Yayāti wandering in different higher worlds, one after another and falls upon earth and again bounce back to heavens. We find in Maha Bharata that he again reaches all these celestial worlds and liberated from the cycle of birth and death.\nWhat is heaven? It is another higher place of enjoyment. If more money is in the packet, one can go from a small hotel to a star hotel in a day and once the pocket becomes empty, he must come back to his home. If more punya is in one’s account, one can reach higher worlds and stay as long as it sustains our existence there. Punya comes from doing social good in the form of yagnas where many people are fed, and charity is done liberally.\nYagna is a karma which gives rise to a result. If it is done for material benefit, it leads to heaven. If it is done without aspiring for the fruit of action, it leads to moksha (where the person is beyond the concepts of merit and de-merit). If it is done to do social injury, it leads to hell. Once the accumulated merit decimates, one must come back. Our scriptures indirectly emphasize the necessity of doing social good with humility. Any social good done for publicity will not attract any merit. Gita says,\n“अभिसन्धाय तु फलं दम्भार्थमपि चैव यत् |इज्यते भरतश्रेष्ठ तं यज्ञं विद्धि राजसम् || Gita17. 12|| abhisandhāya tu phalaṁ dambhārtham api chaiva yat ijyate bharata-śhreṣhṭha taṁ yajñaṁ viddhi rājasam\nIt means that the sacrifice that is done for material benefit or for boasting or for publicity is ‘rajasa’(राजस) yagna; and anything done with hypocritical aim is in passion mode.\nYayāti attained heaven and higher worlds due to his indulgence in good deeds, of course with the aim of personal benefit (or just without karma samnyasa). The heavens are not permanent, and the goal of any seeker is to attain the Ultimate where he escapes the pangs of cycle of births and deaths. This aim of Moksha or liberation is the highest aspiration one should develop as per our scriptures. The aim of Puranas and Itihasas is spread the gospel of vedic essence in the form of stories. Yayāti story just fits into the narrative.\nThe story also highlights the importance of humility and enjoins the spiritual seeker not to develop ego and demean others’ merit. Yayāti ’s fall from heaven symbolizes Vedavyasa’s dictum that ksheene punye martya lokam visanthi- क्षीणे पुण्ये मर्त्य लोकं विशन्ति। (once merit decimates one has to come down from heavens).\nA deep analysis of the story further delineates swarga from that of moksha. Swarga can be attained by doing social good by holding self-interest to the chest. In the modern terminology, it is like social entrepreneurship- doing service to society without forsaking entrepreneurship, thus ensuring sustainable models. Here the seeker is not forsaking the fruits of action. Karma is present but karma yoga is still absent.\nKarma yoga in simple language means holding karma as a tool to attain a skill (karmasu kausalam - कर्मसु कौशलम्). What is that skill? It is the skill to escape from the craving for karmaphala (fruits of action). Here renouncing fruits of action means doing any good deed to society as if you are a tool in the hands of God and do not go despair if it is not accomplished. In more simple words, do good and forget. This gives purity of mind (citta suddhihi-चित्त शुध्दिः) where there is no craze for heaven even when you do social good. Here the seeker will not get affected either by punya (merit) or papa (de-merit) and just he does social good. He feels that doing good attaining heaven is also a desire (काम). Desireless, dispassionate social good itself is enlightenment where the person sees the God in everyone and there is no scope for jealousy, anger etc.\nBut then why do our scriptures talk of heaven when it is not permanent? Hinduism talks about things at two levels. From the perspective of religion (for common people) it enlightens people to do social good. From the perspective of Vedanta (for Jnanis), it talks to raise above religion and discard the religion (त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन।– Gita 2.45).\nFor sending a child to school, it may be necessary to give chocolate, but schooling is not for eating chocolate and the objective is to educate him. Hindu religion shows the chacholate of swarga to common man for doing social good, but its ultimate objective is to go beyond the realms of heaven (chacholate) or hell and to see all in one and one in all. If swargam is the primary standard, moksham is the post-graduate standard. But no one can complete postgraduation without studying primary standard. The purity of thought that is gained for attaining svarga is useful in later years to attain svarga. It is pathetic that people cling to primary standard (heaven) and never think of Post-Graduation (Moksha).\nThus, doing good to society is the basic narrative around which the entire Hinduism revolves.\nPoints to Ponder What is the aim of human life- Heaven or Liberation? How can people attain Heaven? What are the austerities prescribed to attain heaven? When shall a person fall from heaven? When can people get liberated from the cycle of births and deaths? Delineate the subtle differences between Swarga and Moksha? Why Hinduism talks of Heaven when it is impermanent? Transcending above religion and remain in purity of thought is labeled as ‘spiritualism’ by modern people. Don’t you think Hinduism advocated ‘spirituality’ as against ‘religiosity’? ‘Reaching the TOP is easy; retaining the TOP is difficult. Explain the reasons with reference to this story.

We know from the previous episodes that Yayāti swapped his untimely old age with his youngest son Pururava and ruled the country for thousands of years. While he was a king, he performed innumerable Yagnas and amassed enormous amounts of merit (punya) that he was destined by Providence to spend thousands of years in heaven.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Story 20 - The Great Fall of Yayāti - Heaven (Swarga) vis-à-vis Moksha (Liberation)"},{"content":"Background of the Story The Kshatriya king Yayāti married Devayani, a Brahmin on the orders of Sukracharya and Sukracharya exonerated the sin of Varna Sankara attaching to the king. Sukracharya cautioned Yayāti that he should not marry Sarmishta, the daughter of king Vrushaparva who accompanied Devayani as her Dasi (servant). 1\nThe Story Yayāti came back from the hermitage of Sukracharya and started ruling the country with Mahendrapuram as his capital. When Devayani attained puberty, she was blessed with a son.\nऋतुकाले तु सम्प्राप्ते देवयानी वराङ्गना I लेभे गर्भं प्रथमतः कुमारञ्च व्यजायत II 2 – Adi Parva 82. 5 (When she attained puberty, she became pregnant and gave birth to her first son). After a passage of one thousand years, Sarmishta also attained puberty. She wanted to marry a right person, but the question is how to get hold of such person while serving as Dasi to Devayani? She looked at Devayani and her success in life. ‘While she can marry a king of her choice, why can’t I marry as per my choice?’ she thought. She was looking for an opportunity.\nOne day she saw the king Yayāti was roaming in his garden. Without any hesitation, she approached the king and praised him profusely and she modestly asked him, ‘Oh king! You know my lineage, my character and my features. I belong to Kshatriya clan and out of necessity I became the Dasi of Devayani. Now that I attained puberty, I beg your great self to do justice to me’.\nBut Yayāti was hesitant as Sukracharya cautioned him not to marry Sarmishta at any cost. How can he now defy him? Can he not attain the sin of asatyam (not following his promise - untruth)?\nBut Sarmishta said, ‘Oh King! The Sastras say that in the matters of helping ladies, on the occasion of marriages, when there is a threat to one’s own life, or when there is threat of absolute loss of everything - in all these five situations, one can speak untruth and need not stick to old promises’.\nShe continued, ‘Oh King! Devayani is your wife, and you have every right over her and her possessions. I am her Dasi, and you have authority over me also. Moreover, in the kingdom, you have proclaimed to accomplish the desires and wishes of all your subjects. I am in your kingdom, and if you do not accomplish my desire, your words will remain futile, and you will attract the epithet of untruthful person’.\n‘No, not at any point of time!’, interrupted Yayāti. ‘I cannot be untruthful. Tell me your wish’. Sarmishta said,\nअधर्मात् पाहि मां राजन् धर्मञ्च प्रतिपादय I त्वत्तोपत्यवती लोके चरेयं धर्ममुत्तमम् II 3 Adi Parva 82.21 (Oh king, perform Dharma and protect me from adharma. With your grace I will become mother and practice the great Dharma’) ‘One’s own wife, one’s own servant, and one’s own son - all the three have no authority over wealth. Their wealth belongs to those who have authority over them (Adi Parva 82. 22). This is Dharma. I am the property of Devayani and you, being her husband, have control over all her wealth’.\nThe intellectual argument of Sarmishta had the final sway. The king could not refute her arguments, and he honoured her request.\nIn due course of time, Sarmishta gave birth to a child.\nDevayani’s anger - Sukracharya’s curse The news of Sarmishta giving birth to a child was a bolt from the blue to Devayani. With a curt voice she demanded Sarmishta to reveal the father of the boy. But Sarmishta knew the art of handling Devayani. She said, ‘A Dharmic Vedic Brahmin came to my house one day as a guest. I earnestly requested him to fulfil my Dharmic wish, and he obliged. I could not ask his identity as he was resplendent with aura over his face’. Devayani had no objection if it were a Brahmin. She congratulated Sarmishta and left the place.\nNow Yayāti had two sons - Yadu and Turvasu from Devayani; and three sons - Druhya, Anu, and Pooru from Sarmishta. One day Devayani saw all the children playing together and she went and asked Druhyu as to who his father was. The boy pointed his finger at Yayāti. Devayani got wild and she rushed towards her father’s home and complained against the king. With an anxiety Yayāti also rushed towards Sukracharya.\nHe said, Hi Acharya! I believe that I have not transgressed Dharma. Sarmishta approached me and begged to fulfil her wish - ऋतु दानं (ṛtu dānaṃ). If a virgin requests ṛtu dānaṃ after attaining puberty, it is Dharma to fulfil her request. If it is not fulfilled, I attract the sin of भ्रूण हत्य (bhrūṇa hatya - killing of a foetus) as per Sastras and Dharmic Pandits. Further I follow a vratam - that I give whatever being asked by my people. In that way I fulfilled the wish of Sarmishta’. But Sukracharya did not agree. He said, ‘You are my son-in-law, and you are under my control. You should have waited for my orders. Since you have transgressed Dharma, I here by curse you that you shall become old immediately. Instantaneously the young Yayāti became old with grey hair and dilapidated limbs.\nYayāti regaining youth Yayāti could not bear the brunt of old age. He fell on the feet of Sukracharya and said, ‘Acharya! I have not yet fully satisfied with the nuptial bliss of Devayani. Kindly restore my youth’.\nSukracharya said, ‘I agree with you. But I cannot take back my curse. I bless that you can pass on the old age to any of your sons and gain back the youth just by remembering my name. The son who takes your old age shall be your successor to the kingdom’.\nYayāti had two sons- Yadu and Thurvasu from Devayani; and three sons- Druhyu, Anu and Pooru from Sarmishta. No son except Pooru was willing to sacrifice the youth for the sake of the father. Yayāti was pleased with the pleasant sacrifice of his son Pooru and blessed him that he shall be the future king of Mahendrapuram. He was wild with his other sons and cursed them individually. He cursed his eldest son Yadu that his progeny can never become kings.\nYayathi enjoyed the pleasures of worldly life for thousand years. His desires did not still come down. Yet he got back his old age and gave the youth back to Pooru.\nHe famously said:\nन जातु कामः कामानामुपभोगेन शाम्यति । हविषा कृष्णवर्त्मैव भूय एवाभिवर्धते ॥ 4 (Adi Parva 85.12) यत् पृथिव्यां व्रीहि यवं हिरण्यं पशवः स्त्रियः । एकस्यापि न पर्याप्तं तस्मात्तृष्णाम् परित्यजेत् ॥ 5 (Adi Parva 85.13) (As long as you are enjoying sensual pleasures, they keep on increasing. Just as the flakes of fire flare up on consuming each firewood, the desires keep on growing on enjoying them again and again’ ‘Whatever the wealth- gold, grains, and girls that is there in this world is not sufficient for a single person. They don’t satiate his desires. So, one should abandon or drop out the desires from the mind’)\nThe Coronation of Pooru Now Yayāti wanted to enthrone Pooru and consulted his Purohits. The Chief Purohit said, ‘Oh King! Your eldest son Yadu is alive. How can you pass on the kingdom to your youngest son? It is not Dharma’.\nYayāti said, ‘I agree with your proposition. But Yadu is not a good son. A son is good if he obliges his father’s wishes. All my sons except Pooru refused to help me when I was in distress. Pooru is one who obliged my request and suffered the ordeal of old age. Further Sukracharya had given me the boon that whichever son adhere my words shall become the future king’.\nThe Purohits agreed for the proposition and coronated Pooru with all pomp and pleasure. Yayāti took Vānaprastha (वानप्रस्थ) and proceeded to forests with the aim of peaceful meditation and for attaining higher lokas.\nPooru became the progenitor of Puru clan (later on the famous Kuru clan of Kauravas); Yadu for Yadavas (Sri Krishna was born in this clan); Thurvasa became the progenitor for Yavanas (Alexander is said to belong to this clan) and Anu was the progenitor of Mlechhas (said to be the current tribes of Assam).\nWhat happened to Yayāti later? We shall discuss in our next episode.\nUnderstanding the Story From the story it is quite evident that Devayani was not biologically mature by the time of her marriage. Even Sarmishta attained puberty after a thousand years from Devayani’s marriage with Yayā How can a girl become adolescent after thousand years? We need to understand that the setting of the story is not from that of current Kali Yug. According to Sastras, the average longevity in Satya Yug was one lakh years; ten thousand years in Treta Yug; one thousand years in Dwapar Yug and hundred years in Kali Yug. Mahabharata story happened in Dwapar Yug when the average longevity was ten one thousand years. The onset of puberty in Dwapar Yug cannot be compared with present Kali Yug. In the matters of marriage, girls enjoyed freedom in ancient societies. Devayani chose her husband and got consent from her father. The general principle was that on attaining puberty, it is ok for the girl to approach a suitable bridegroom for ऋतु दानं (ṛtu dānaṃ) if her marriage was not decided by the father by that time. Society was tolerant and the girl had a choice to choose the husband. We also find that if the man refuses the genuine request, he attains the sin of भ्रूण हत्य (bhrūṇa hatya - killing of a foetus). Dharma was the bedrock upon which the society was functioning in Mahabharata times. But by the fag end of Dwapar Yug, there was visible, but slow deterioration of Dharma. Truth or Satyam was put on high pedestal for leading the life. But certain exceptions were always made for speaking untruth, viz, in the matters of helping ladies, on the occasion of marriages, when there is a threat to one’s own life, or when there is threat of absolute loss of everything - in all these five situations, one can speak untruth and need not stick to old promises. The law books or Dharma Sastras were accommodating the realities of social life, and the society was certainly flexible. In Mahabharata times, there was no concept of woman enjoying physical wealth. Husband had full control over the wealth of his wife. This does not mean that the wife was deprived of all luxuries of life. In fact, she was the queen of the house. Look at this Vedic mantra recited in marriages. स॒म्राज्ञी॒ श्वशु॑रे भव स॒म्राज्ञी॑ श्व॒श्र्वां भ॑व । नना॑न्दरि स॒म्राज्ञी॑ भव स॒म्राज्ञी॒ अधि॑ दे॒वृषु॑ ॥ – Rig Veda 10.85.46 (It means - “Be a queen to your father-in-law, be a queen to your mother-in-law, be a queen to your husband’s sister, be a queen to your husband’s brother.” In simple words she is the queen of the house without a crown; and she is part of all family decisions; and her conduct with in-laws, cousins and others make her supreme in all matters relating to Dharma, Artha and Kāma. Once a wife, she used to enjoy the wealth of the family as a whole. ‘Desirelessness is the highest state of bliss’- this is the general theme that runs throughout Mahabharata and this was given more emphasis in Bhagavadgita which is part of Mahabharata. Happiness is within the Self, and no amount of outside pleasure satiate the desires of a person interested in liberation from births and deaths (Moksha). This was emphasised by Yayāti when he states ‘न जातु कामः कामानामुपभोगेन शाम्यति । हविषा कृष्णवर्त्मैव भूय एवाभिवर्धते’ ॥ (As long as you are enjoying sensual pleasures, they keep on increasing. Just as the flakes of fire flare up on consuming each firewood, the desires keep on growing on enjoying them again and again). This is the most famously quoted sloka from Mahabharata. It denounces consumerism and encourages to lead a life of contentment. In this story we find Yayāti abdicating the kingdom and proceeding towards forests. This stage of life is popularly christened as Vānaprastha(वानप्रस्थ). Once the children attain the capacity to take up the responsibilities of the household, the Grihastha has to bestow all the responsibilities upon them and leave for āśramas and forests. This is done to meditate on the eternal Truth and develop dispassion and vairagyam. In Mahabharata we come across many stories when the kings abdicate their thrones in favour of children to spend secluded life in forests. Wife can accompany but the couple should live in brahmacharya. Vānaprastha āśrama ensures empowerment of children and it is the best way to ensure that one should not become burden on one’s children. In modern times, many people have totally forgotten this stage and cling to their children, grandchildren and houses leaving little time for self-meditation or understanding the final Truths. Were Balarama and Sri Krishna kings of Dwaraka? - In the current story we find Yayāti cursing his eldest son Yadu that his progeny can never become kings. Balarama and Sri Krishna were from the lineage of Yadu (they were यादवास्- Yādavās). So, they never assumed as formal kings. Sri Krishna, after killing Kamsa, released Ugrasena from the prison and installed him as the Samrat again and conducted the affairs of the kingdom on his behalf. From the story we find that the principle of inheritance to the eldest son was broken by the progenitor of Kuru clan, one of the earliest clans of Ancient Bharath. Points to Ponder Can we satisfy the senses by indulging in sensual pleasures? What is responsible for the unhappiness of a human being? Do you feel that the society was flexible in the matters of marriage in ancient India? Do you think that females of ancient India had more freedom in the matters of marriages? The tribes in India are broadly from common progenitor. Can this awareness help in reducing tensions among tribes and States of modern India?

Apart from this the story talks of the clash of two ego-centric characters. 1\nThe Story Devayani was the daughter of Sukrācārya, the family guru of daityas (also called Asuras or Demons). At that time, the king of Asuras was Vrushaparva and he had a daughter by name Sarmishta. Devayani and Sarmishta were friends and on one day they went out for a forest accompanied by a huge number of servant maids and care takers. After roaming for a while they entered a pond of water, and they were swimming with joy. It so happened that a gush wind from the bushes galvanized the area where the ladies had dropped their robes, and all the robes got mixed up.\nThe clash of Egos Sarmishta came out of the pond first and in a state of hurry wore the robes of Devayani. Devayani got perplexed and she warned Sarmishta for her act of negligence. Sarmishta, being the daughter of the king, did not take it lightly. ‘You are the daughter of one who stands arms-fold before my father and how dare you warn me? Your father is dependent on my father for alms and comforts. I do not care you’, she yelled, and she pushed Devayani into an unused dry well; and thinking that she must have dead, she proceeded with her entourage towards the city.\nIt was almost night and one king by name Yayāti was roaming in the forest searching for water. He heard the cries of Devayani and approached the unused well and found Devayani crying from the bottom of the well. Devayani revealed her identity as the daughter of Sukrācārya and upon her request, he pulled her out from the well.\nDevayani said, ‘Oh! King, you have taken my hand and extricated me from difficulty. Since you have held my hand, you would be my husband’. But Yayāti was not ready for the proposal. He said, ‘Oh, Lady! You are a Brahmin, and I am a Kshatriya. Your father is a Guru and well known for the knowledge and interpretation of Sastras. Our union cannot be appreciated by anybody. Moreover, I fear your father’.\nDevayani smiled at him and said, ‘Fine! I can marry you with the consent of my father only. Now you can go’, and Yayāti left the place.\nWhen Devayani did not turn up to home till night, Sukrācārya sent a maid to search for his daughter in the forest. Devayani was unable to bear the insult and wanted to take revenge against Sarmishta. She sent a word through the maid to her father that she would not enter the city of Vrushaparva anymore.\nSukrācārya hurriedly came to the spot to see the plight of his daughter. He heard everything from her. A true Brahmin (guna or qualities define a Brahmin and not mere birth) cannot afford to get excited by the temporary difficulties. He tried to console his daughter:\nआत्मदोषैर्नियच्छन्ति सर्वे दुःखसुखे जनाः I मन्ये दुश्चरितं तेsस्ति यस्येयं निष्कृतिः कृता II (Adi Parva 78.30) ‘My Dear daughter! Listen. In this world every one of us gets happiness or unhappiness by virtue of our karma (deeds). One must endure the happenings with equanimity and that is the only way to get rid of past mistakes.2\nBut Devayani was not relenting. She said, Oh, Father! Sarmishta has blamed that you stand before the king arms-fold. Is it true? If it is true, I will go to her and beg pardon from her. Sukrācārya told, ‘it is not certainly true. By the blessings of Bramha I have a lot of power and wealth and all daityas seek my help for all matters. You need not take to your head what Sarmishta told to you out of ignorance. Please come and let us go to the city’. Still Devayani did not agree. Her anger was rebounding with the thought of invectives hurled against her by Sarmishta.\nEffects of Krodham or anger Krodham or anger is self-destructive and destroys the bearer more than the borne. Sukrācārya knew this. He said, ‘My dear daughter! Anger does not give any greatness to anybody. The one who bears the invectives with equanimity and never retaliates is the greatest person upon this earth.\nयो यजेदपरिश्रान्तः मासि मासि शतं समाः । न क्रुद्धेद्यश्च सर्वस्य तयोरक्रोधनोsधिकः ।। – Adi Parvam 79.6 (Without any laziness even if a person performs yagna every month for a hundred years, he is considered inferior before a person who never exhibits any anger against anybody) 3 He further said, ‘Oh Daughter! Anger is not good for us. An angry person loses his own wife, son, servant, and friend. He loses Dharma and Truth. Please desist from anger’.\nDevayani said, ‘I know the Dharma and I can understand your teachings. But the issue is that Sarmishta has blamed me without any basis, and you being a Guru cannot pardon those who deviate the path of Dharma. One should live in the company of sober and good people. I desist from going to the kingdom since they have become immoderate and imprudent. Let us stay away from the king and the kingdom’.\nSukrācārya summoned Vrushaparva and narrated all the events and told that he would leave all the daityas and go away to some other place. The asuras had been safe due to the blessings of Sukrācārya all these days and Vrushaparva was quite worried. He rushed towards Devayani and sought her pardon. He was prepared to do whatever the order of Devayani was. Devayani wanted that Sarmishta should become her slave. In the interest of all asuras, Sarmishta also agreed to the condition, and she became the slave of Devayani.\nYears rolled by and one day both Sarmishta and Devayani set out for forest. They happened to meet Yayāti. ‘A few years back, you took my right hand (पाणिग्रहण – Pāṇigrahaṇa) and restored me from the well. So, by the destiny of the almighty you alone can be my husband. Please take me as your wife’, Devayani requested.\n“But you are the daughter of a Brahmin (Sukrācārya) and I am a Kshatriya. How can it be possible?’ queried Yayāti.\nDevayani said,\nसंसृष्टं ब्रह्मणा क्षत्रं क्षत्रेण ब्रह्म संहितम् (Adi Parva 81.19) ‘Hi, Maharaj, for long the both Varnas- Bramhins and Khatriyas are getting united. So, you can marry me’ 4 pleaded Devayani. She requested her father, Sukrācārya to interfere in the matter. Yayāti was afraid of the sin of वर्ण सांकर्यं (Varṇa sāṃkaryaṃ) and he requested that he should be exonerated from the sin. Sukrācārya agreed and consented for the marriage of a Kshatriya with a Brahmin girl.\nBut, before marriage he put a condition to Yayāti that he should not develop any affair with Sarmishta (now a slave to Devayani).\nIn our next story, we will see if Yayāti had obliged to the words of Sukrācārya and stuck to Devayani alone.\nAnalysis of the Story पाणिग्रहण (Pāṇigrahaṇa) We normally equate Pāṇigrahaṇa with marriage. But it is one of the aspects of marriage. ‘Pāṇi’ means palm of the hand and ‘grahaṇa’ means to hold. The bride and the groom, when they hold their hands together, it signifies Pāṇigrahaṇa. In Vedic marriages, this aspect is conducted by the priest after the मंगळ सूत्र धारणा or tying the holy knot by the bridegroom and ‘saptapadi’. The priest conducts this ritual with the following mantra and others:\n‘पूषात्वेतो नयतु हस्तगृह्य अश्विनौत्वा प्रवाहतान् रदेन गृहान् गच्छ गृहपत्नी यधसोवशि नीत्वं विवधं अवदासि ……………………….’5 which means ‘let the Sun and the Aswin Gods protect you. As the princess of the family, you come home to set things in good stead. I hold your hand to have the progeny and live till old age.\nJust holding the hand of a lady may not signify marriage as it does not involve the pronunciation of Vedic mantras. The Vedic Pāṇigrahaṇa is meant to usher in friendliness (sakhyatha) and the protection of the bride throughout the rest of life. It also gives authority to the bride to take care of the family in right earnest.\nवर्ण सांकर्यं (Varṇa sāṃkaryaṃ) Varna is different from caste. Varna of a person is based on his Guna (nature - Satvik, Rajasik or Tamasik) and karma (nature of work). चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागश:| 6 - thus speaks Sri Krishna in Bhagavadgita. Guna or nature of a person can be Satvik, Satvik-Rajasik, Rajasik-Tamasik and Tamasik. Karma of a person can be intellectuality, protection, business and menial work. Depending on Guna and Karma, a person’s Varna is decided as Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vysya and Sudra. Varna is not decided just by birth in a particular family. As per Manu Dharma Sastra, once a boy is born, he is monitored by a scholarly person of the village, and he decides the boy’s Varna when he attains the age of eight. Mahabharata clearly gives us a message that a person can go up the ladder or falls from the hierarchy by virtue of cultivating the Gunas or foregoing the Gunas.\nThis type of Varna system degenerated over centuries due to the intermingling of Varnas resulting in the birth of castes as we do observe today. In Mahabharata we find certain castes like Suta, Chandala, Nishada etc. Over a period of years, the birth of the person was the deciding factor for designating his caste and this system became rigid.\nVarṇa sāṃkaryaṃ means inter-mingling of Varnas by virtue of marriages. This was being frowned at or not encouraged though they were happening in Mahabharata times also. In Gita Arjun talks of Varṇa sāṃkaryaṃ and he says that it results in Pitru Devatas becoming unhappy. He says:\nसङ्करो नरकायैव कुलघ्नानां कुलस्य च | पतन्ति पितरो ह्येषां लुप्तपिण्डोदकक्रिया: || 7 Gita1. 42. (Increase in unwanted children results in hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall). In the story of Dharmavyadha, we witness Dharmavyadha saying that the king Janaka was protecting the Varna system, and he was never allowing Varṇa sāṃkaryaṃ. Likewise in many other places, we find the kings protecting the rhythm of Varna Dharma as one of their duties.\nIn the present story we find Devayani (a Brahmin) seeking the marriage with Yayāti (a Kshatriya) thereby violating the principle of Varna Dharma. She justifies it and seeks the help of her father Sukrācārya, who is known for his scholarship of Sastras. When Yayāti was afraid of Varṇa sāṃkaryaṃ, Sukrācārya permitted their marriage and exonerated Yayāti from the sin.\nIn summary, we find that Varṇa sāṃkaryaṃ, though looked upon as a sinful act, was being allowed depending on circumstances and necessities.\nPoints to Ponder What is equation of Guru (spiritual Master) with the king (Temporal Master) in Hindu system of Political Thought? What factors drive a person to anger mode? Do you feel that the society was flexible in the matters of marriage in ancient India? What is वर्ण सांकर्यं (Varṇa sāṃkaryaṃ)? What is meant by पाणि ग्रहणं (Pāṇi grahaṇaṃ)? Was slavery present in ancient India? If so, how is it different from that of Western countries? What are the effects of Krodham?

Incidentally he said that no rishi would marry Devayani. Janamejaya wanted to listen the later part of Devayani story. 1\nDevayani \u0026amp; Sarmishta - A rivalry Devayani was the daughter of Sukrācārya, the family guru of daityas (also called Asuras or Demons). At that time, the king of Asuras was Vrushaparva and he had a daughter by name Sarmishta. Devayani and Sarmishta were friends and on one day they went out to a forest accompanied by a huge number of servant maids and care takers. After roaming for a while they entered into a pond of water and were swimming with joy. It so happened that a gush wind from the bushes galvanized the entire area where the ladies had dropped their robes, and all the robes got mixed up.\nSarmishta came out of the pond and in a state of hurry wore the robes of Devayani. Devayani got wild and started cursing Sarmishta for her act of negligence. Sarmishta did not like the arrogance of Devayani as she was in no way inferior to her. Sarmishta, being the daughter of the king, did not take the insults lightly. ‘You are the daughter of one who stands arms-fold before my father and how dare you curse me?’, she yelled and she pushed Devayani into an unused dry well; and thinking that she must have dead, she proceeded with her entourage towards the city.\nIt was almost becoming night and one king by name Yayāthi was roaming in the forest searching for water. He heard the cries of Devayani and approached the unused well and found Devayani crying from the bottom of the well. Devayani revealed her identity as the daughter of Sukrācārya, and upon her request, he pulled her out from the well. Devayani was unable to bear the insult and wanted to take revenge against Sarmishta. She sent a word through a maid to her father that she would not enter the city of Vrushaparva anymore.\nSukrācārya hurriedly came to the spot to see the plight of his daughter. He heard everything. A true Brahmin (gunas or qualities define a Brahmin and not mere birth) cannot afford to get excited by the temporary difficulties. He tried to console his daughter,\nआत्मदोषैर्नियच्छन्ति सर्वे दुःख सुखे जनाः I मन्ये दुश्चरितं त तेsस्ति यस्येयं निष्कृतिः कृता II (Adi Parva 78.30) 2 (‘My Dear daughter! Listen. In this world every one of us gets happiness or unhappiness by virtue of our karma (deeds). One has to endure the happenings with equanimity and that is the only way to get rid of past mistakes’) But Devayani was not relenting. ‘She has blamed that you stand before the king arms-fold. Is it true? If it is true, I will go to her and beg pardon from her’. Sukrācārya said, ‘It is not certainly true. By the blessings of Bramha I have lot of power and wealth and all Asuras seek my help for all matters. You need not take to your head what Sarmishta had told to you out of ignorance. Please come and let us go to the city’. Still Devayani did not agree.\nThere is no way to please his daughter. Sukrācārya went to Vrushaparva and narrated all the events and told that he would leave all the Asuras and go away to some other place. The Asuras had been safe due to the blessings of Sukrācārya all these days and Vrushaparva was quite worried. He rushed towards Devayani and sought her pardon. He was prepared to do whatever was the order of Devayani. Devayani wanted that Sarmishta should become her dāsī (loosely translated as slave). In the interest of all Asuras, Sarmishta also agreed for the condition, and she became the dāsī of Devayani.\nDevayani weds Yayāthi Years rolled by and one day both Sarmishta and Devayani set out for forest. They happened to meet Yayāthi. ‘A few years back, you took my right hand (पाणिग्रहण - pāṇigrahaṇa) and restored me from the well. So, by the destiny of the Almighty you alone can be my husband. Please take me as your wife’, Devayani requested.\n“But you are the daughter of a Brahmin (Sukrācārya) and I am a Kshatriya. How is it possible?’ queried Yayāthi.\n‘Yes, Maharaj, for long the both Varnas- Bramhins and Khatriyas are getting united. So, you can marry me’ (संसृष्टं ब्रह्मणा क्षत्रं क्षत्रेण ब्रह्म संहितम् – Adi Parva 81.19) 3 pleaded Devayani.\nBut Yayāthi was hesitant to marry a Brahmin lady for the fear that he would attract the sin of varna sankara (the sin of the alliance of two different varnas).\nएकदेहोद्भवा वर्णा: चत्वारोsपि वरांगने I पृथग् धर्मा: पृथक् शौचा: तेषाम् तु ब्राह्मणो वरः II 4 – Adi Parva 81.20\n(Oh, Devayani! These four varnas- Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vysyas and Shudras emerged out of a same person. But each has its own dharmas and behaviours. Out of these four varnas, the Brahmin is superior.)\n‘The anger of a Brahmin destroys the whole world. I cannot marry you without the consent of your father’. Devayani immediately called her father and said, ‘Oh father! This is Yayāthi, the son of king Nahusha. I love him and I cannot live without him’. But Yayāthi was not willing to violate dharma, thereby indulge in varna Sankara.\nSukrācārya consented for the marriage and assured Yayāthi that he would exonerate him out of the sin and blessed the marriage. Before marriage he put a condition to Yayāthi that he should not develop any affair with Sarmishta (now a dāsī to Devayani). Yayāthi married Devayani and got two children - Yadu and Turvasu from her.\nSarmishta attained puberty after a period of thousand years (गते वर्ष सहस्रे तु शर्मिष्टा वार्षपर्वणी - gate varṣa sahasre tu śarmiṣṭā vārṣaparvaṇī – Adi Parva 82.5) 5. She was a dāsī to Devayani and how could she find her husband? One day she approached Yayāthi when he was alone and requested him to marry her. Yayāthi reminded the condition put forth by Sukrācārya that he cannot marry Sarmishta.\nSarmishta said, ‘Oh king! In times of marriage, in the context of ladies, and for saving one’s own life it is okay to tell untruth; and it is dharma’.\nShe also said, ‘Oh, king! You have complete authority over your wife Devayani and all her belongings are your belongings. I am her dāsī and I belong to you; and it is dharma to take my hand also. Moreover, as a king you have announced that you would bestow whatever that is sought by your subjects. As a subject, I seek your company and beg you to bestow a son to me’.\nYayāthi was pleased by the dharmic argument of Sarmishta and honoured her request. Sarmishta convinced Devayani that she became pregnant by the blessings of a rishi. In due course of time, she gave birth to three children - Druhyu, Anu, and Pūru.\nSukrācārya curses Yayāthi One day Devayani observed the three children of Sarmishta playing with Yayāthi. She came to know from the children that Yayāthi was their father. Tears rolled down from her eyes and she rushed to her father.\nYayāthi said, ‘Oh respectable Rishi! Sarmishta approached me for पुत्रदानं (putradānaṃ) and as a king I had the duty to honour her request. Furthermore, If I refuse ऋतुदानं (ṛtudānaṃ), I attract the sin of committing भ्रूण हत्य (bhrūṇa hatya) 6. But Sukrācārya was not convinced. ‘You are under my control, and you should have taken my advice before marrying Sarmishta’.\nYayāthi tried to convince again and again but he could not morally defend his case as he violated the promise given to Sukrācārya. Sukrācārya cursed him that he would become premature old. Instantly Yayāthi became old, but he had the craving for sensual pleasures and desires, and he wanted to enjoy youth for some more years. He begged to show some lenience and upon his request Sukrācārya remitted the sentence and he allowed Yayāthi to exchange his old age with the youth of any of his sons.\nYayāthi had two sons- Yadu and Thurvasu from Devayani; and three sons- Druhyu, Anu and Puru from Sarmishta. No son except Puru was willing to sacrifice the youth for the sake of the father. Yayāthi cursed all his disobeying sons. He was pleased with Puru who sacrificed his youth for the sake of his father. Yayāthi enjoyed the pleasures of worldly life for thousand years. His desires did not still come down. Yet he got back his old age and gave the youth back to Puru.\nHe famously said,\nन जातु कामः कामानुपभोगेन शाम्यति । हविषा कृष्णवर्त्मैव भूय एवाभिवर्धते ॥ (Adi Parva 85.12) 7 (‘As long as you are enjoying sensual pleasures, they keep on increasing. Just as the flakes of fire flame up on consuming each firewood, the desires keep growing on enjoying them again and again’) यत् पृथिव्यां व्रीहियवं हिरण्यं पशवः स्त्रियः एकस्यापि न पर्याप्तं तस्मात्तृष्णाम् परित्यजेत् (Adi Parva 85.13) 8 (‘Whatever the wealth- gold, grains, and girls that are there in this world are not sufficient for a single person. They don’t satiate his desires. So, one should abandon or drop out the desires from the mind’) He gave the kingdom to Puru and went for forests for penance. Puru became the progenitor of Puru clan (later on the famous Kuru clan of Kauravas); Yadu for Yadavas (Sri Krishna was born in this clan); Thurvasa became the progenitor for Yavanas (Alexander is said to belong to this clan) and Anu was the progenitor of Mlechhas (said to be the current tribes of Assam).\nPoints to ponder The story discusses the issue of dāsī (slavery). We had also seen the issue of slavery when Vinata became a dāsī to Kadru in Maha Bharata (See my earlier post - Story 9). Was it prevalent in ancient India? How rigorous it was? How was slavery different from that of other countries? Let us discuss the issue very briefly.\nWe see in the said episode Vinata carrying Kadruva on her back; and Garutmanta attending to errand works of the serpents. This is the only reference to show the ill treatment meted out to slaves. We come to know that slavery was there in ancient societies across the world, and it was again hereditary. But the so-called slavery in India was upon consent and for a cause. It was not by violence and force. Sarmishta became dāsī to Devayani lest the Guru Sukrācārya desert the asuras (demons). So, she agreed to become dāsi for a larger cause, the cause of saving Asuras from enemies. Dharmaraja bet his brothers and wife and became a dāsa (slave) to Duryodhana in the first game of dice because it was on his own volition he agreed to the terms and conditions of the game, and he never wanted to go away from his words. Vinata lost the bet with Kadruva and she agreed to become a dāsī.\nWhen we compare the slavery in Africa or in America or in Ancient Greece, we find that it was based on force and often at the tip of the gun point. The Europeans forcefully enclaved Africans and transported to America for menial works. Again, there was no evidence of any slave getting relief from slavery. Serious and inquisitive readers may see the book ‘The History of Torture throughout the Ages’ by George Ryley Scott, Luxor Press, London) for immediate references as to how the system of slavery was ruthless, violent and forceful in western societies.\n‘नजातुकामः कामानुपभोगेन शाम्यति ।‘- It is a famous and oft-quoted statement from Mahabharata. Desires cannot be extinguished by fulfilling the desires. They keep growing just as the fire flares up by adding the fuel. One has to abandon the desires to achieve the perfection in life. In Gita Sri Krishna emphasises- प्रजहाति यदा कामान्सर्वान्पार्थ मनोगतान् | आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्ट: स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते || 2. 55|| (Sthitapragna is one who has abandoned all desires arising out of the mind, and who finds happiness from within).\nThe characters of Devayani and Sarmishta depict the most empowered ladies who could choose their destinies in the face of adversities. Both are learned and argued their point of opinion. They were courting and choosing their husbands on attaining puberty. Meeting the man of her choice for marriage was not a taboo. Ancient Indian woman was highly empowered to meet and ask for पुत्रदानं (putradānaṃ) from the man of her choice. They were commanding respect from their spouses and other family members.\nआपद्धर्म - āpaddharma: We come across a passage from the mouth of Sarmishta - ‘In times of marriage, in the context of ladies, and for saving one’s own life it is okay to tell untruth; and it is dharma’. In Mahabharata we come across the concept of आपद्धर्म - āpaddharma to tide over difficult situations. The term ‘āpad’ means danger or difficulty. When life is at stake or for performing a marriage or in difficult situations, it is okay to deviate from the dharma. This does not mean that one can be licentious and act at will. आपद्धर्म - āpaddharma has to be judiciously exercised and should be justified.\nवर्णाश्रमधर्म - varṇāśramadharma: A king in Mahabharata times was supposed to protect varṇāśramadharma, ie, he was supposed to prevent the intermingling of Varnas and protect āś Yayāthi being a Kshatriya, therefore, refused to marry Devayani as she happened to be a Brahmin. He knew very well that all Varnas emerged out of a single source and Varnas are the division in the society based of duties and temperaments of the people. He did not want to attract the sin of Varna Sankara. But Sukrācārya exonerated his son by applying the principle of āpaddharma to save the life of his daughter. From this story, we can deduce that society in those times was liberal and Varna Sankara was not frowned at.\nQuestions What is equation of Guru (spiritual Master) with the king (Temporal Master) in Hindu system of Political Thought? What factors drive a person to pick up cudgels with a fellow human being? Do you feel that ego and jealousy are triggers for the breaking up of human relations? Can we satisfy the senses by indulging in sensual pleasures? What is responsible for the unhappiness of a human being? Do you feel that the society was flexible in the matters of marriage in ancient India? The tribes in India are broadly from common progenitor. Can this awareness help in reducing tensions among tribes and States of modern India?

Now he was inquisitive to know the story of Kuru Vamsa from Vysampayana, and he started narrating the story.\nDaksha prajāpati (hereinafter wards mentioned as Daksha) was the mānasa putra (born out of the manas) of Brahmaa. He was the progenitor of the entire world, and to procreate the species, he married several wives. It is said that all the twenty-seven stars (nakshatras) who later married the Moon God, Chandra were his daughters. Parvati, the wife of Lord Siva was his daughter. His two daughters Adithi and Dithi were married to Kasyapa. Through Adithi and Dithi he got all the Gods and Asuras as his sons. Through Vinata and Kadru he got Garutmantha and all the serpents respectively.\nVivasvat or Surya (the Sun God) was the son of Kasyapa, and Surya’s sons were Manu and Yama. Manu was the first human being (man) upon the earth and hence the entire human race is called mānavās. Purūrava was the grandson of Manu. He was one of the greatest kings upon the earth and hence his Vamsa became to be known as Puru vamsa. Nahusha was the son of Purūrava, and Yayāti was the son of Nahusha. Yayāti became the samrat of the universe and he was a very popular emperor. He, though a kshatriya, married a brahmin lady, Devayāni and later a kshatriya lady, Sarmishta under different circumstances.\nWhile hearing this anecdote, Janamejaya interrupted Vysampayana and asked, ‘Oh sage! What are those circumstances? Why did he marry a brahmin lady? Please elaborate’. Vysampayana started narrating the story of Devayani.\nDevayāni \u0026amp; Yayāti Once upon a time there broke out a terrible war between the Devas (Gods) and Asuras (Rākṣasās) over the world’s resources. Sukrācārya was the purohit of Asuras and Brihaspati was the purohit of Gods. Both Sukrācārya and Brihaspati were brahmins but were bitter rivals. Sukrācārya had a special knowledge of a mantra by name Mrutha sanjīvanī by which the dead Asuras were brought back to life. Brihaspati was not aware of Mrutha sanjīvanī, and hence, he could not breathe life into the dead bodies of the Gods.\nWhen the strength of Gods was dwindling, they got afraid and approached Kacha, the son of Brihaspathi. They requested him to approach Sukrācārya as a disciple and learn the Mrutha sanjīvanī vidya from him. Kacha obliged the request of the Gods, and he approached Sukrācārya. Sukrācārya accepted Kacha as his disciple and initiated Brahmacharya vratam.\nKacha was young and handsome and equally dexterous in fine arts. He used to entertain his Guru and his daughter Devayāni by singing, dancing and playing the violin. Years were rolling upon and Devayāni started developing love towards the young Kacha. Even Sukrācārya had a special place in his heart for him.\nAsuras got jealous of Kacha and were apprehensive that he may steal the Mrutha sanjīvanī vidya from Sukrācārya by dubious means. One day in the thick of the forest they killed him and threw his body to wild animals. The Sun was set, and the cows returned home. Kacha who went as a cowherd was not to be seen. Devayāni got agitated.\n‘Father! Kacha has not come back from the forest. He might have been killed by your other disciples. Without him I cannot live’.\nSukrācārya had a great attachment towards his daughter. He applied Mrutha sanjīvanī and invited Kacha. Kacha came out of the stomachs of wild animals. Asuras were unhappy with the turn of events. One day again they killed Kacha, burnt his body to ashes, mixed it in sura (an intoxicating drink) and gave it to Sukrācārya.\nThe Sun was set, and the cows returned home. Kacha who went as a cowherd was not to be seen. Again, Devayāni got agitated. She requested his father to bring back the life of Kacha. With his Divya Drishti (the power of seeing the unseen objects) Sukrācārya could realize that Kacha was very much inside his stomach.\n‘Oh! Devayani! Kacha is inside my stomach. If I bring back his life, I am sure to die’.\n‘Oh! I am now wrapped in a great dilemma. Without Kacha, there is no meaning for my life. Without you, my life ends’\nSukrācārya mustered courage and applied Mrutha sanjīvanī and brought back the life of Kacha. He taught Mrutha sanjīvanī to Kacha and said, ‘Now you are very much alive inside my stomach. Come out of my stomach and use the Mrutha sanjīvanī to bring back my life’.\nKacha tore open the stomach of his own Guru and found his Guru lying in a pool of blood. Immediately he pronounced Mrutha sanjīvanī. Sukrācārya is now alive, and he blessed his benevolent disciple.\nSukrācārya’s code of Law to Brahmins Sukrācārya introspected the cause for teaching Mrutha sanjīvanī vidya to the son of Brihaspati who was his rival. He could realize, ‘Yes! It is my addiction to sura- the alcoholic drink. In an inebriated state I have consumed more and more alcohol, and I have not realized when it is mixed with ashes.\nHe rose up in anger and set a code of law to Brahmins -\nयोब्राह्मणोsद्यप्रभृतीह कश्चित् मोहात् सुरां पास्यति मंदबुद्धि: I अपेतधर्मा ब्रह्महा चैव स स्याद् **अस्मिंल्लोके गर्हितः स्यात् परेच II 1 Adi Parva 76.67\n(From now on, if any Brahmin consumes alcohol out of foolishness and delusion, he is astray from dharma, and he gets the sin of Brahmahatya. He shall be blamed in this world and other worlds also)\nKacha stayed with his Guru for some more years and sought the permission of Sukrācārya to relieve him from his Ashrama so that he could go back to his father’s place. Sukrācārya had no problem in relieving him since he had completed his विद्याभ्यास (vidyābhyāsa). But Devayani had her own reasons for otherwise. She asked Kacha to marry her.\nKacha was totally aghast. ‘You are my Guru Putri - daughter of my Guru. Guru is like my father, and you are like my sister. We cannot transgress dharma’\nDevayani said, ‘Oh Kacha! You are not supposed to tell like this. You cannot claim my father as your father. The Asuras had killed you many times and my love towards you saved your life. Please recollect. I am seeking your hand out of dharma- as you know that kāma is one of the puruṣārthās 2 of human life’.\nKacha said, ‘But, I had in the womb of your father. You are my sister as per dharma. I cannot transgress dharma’.\nDevayani got offended and cursed, ‘Since you have rejected my dharmic request, the Mrutha sanjīvanī shall not work for you’.\nKacha heard Devayani but he did not curse her back. He had no anger against her. He said, ‘For a rishi like me, Guru is the father. Out of lust you have cursed me ignoring rishi dharma. No rishi shall marry you. Let Mrutha sanjīvanī not work for me. But it shall work for all those who get the knowledge from me’, saying thus he left for his father’s place. He preached the Mrutha sanjīvanī to all the Gods and they were very happy. Since the fear of death decimated, the Gods thought of waging a fresh war with Asuras.\nJanamejaya heard the story and said, ‘Oh Vysampayana Rishi! Please narrate the story of Devayani. What happened to her later? Who married her? How Devayani’s story is relevant for understanding the origin of Kuru vamsa?’\nVysampayana smiled at the king and started narrating the story.\nPoints to ponder This story talks of frequent battles and the victory of Asuras and the death of Gods. Perhaps the events of this story precede the Amritha mathanam (refer the story 10- Churning of the ocean in this same blog). Gods were not having the knowledge of reviving the life from the death, and the Guru of Asuras possessed the same knowledge thus creating the balance of power favorably inclined towards Asuras.\nAt the end of the story, we realize that both Gods and Asuras possessed the knowledge of Mrutha Sanjīvanī. Then why did both of them churn the great ocean for attaining Amrith, the nectar? The Mahabharata heralds the story of evolution of civilization wherein there has been a constant urge to attain victory over death. The quest for finding a remedy for poisonous deaths is prominently positioned in the beginning of Adi parva itself by way stories such as उत्तांकोपाख्यानं, क्षीर सागर मथनं, सर्पयाग घट्टं (uttāṃkopākhyānaṃ, kṣīra sāgara mathanaṃ, sarpayāga ghaṭṭaṃ) 3 The knowledge of Mrutha Sanjīvanī by rishi Sukrācārya is one great milestone in the process. The revival of life to the tree that was scorched to ashes by Takshaka clearly demonstrates the knowledge of poisons and remedies.\nThen why did Asuras and Gods strive to attain Amrit? Mrutha Sanjīvanī is essentially tāmasik (तामसिक) in nature in the sense that it helps in giving life to the dead body. But it cannot guarantee vigor \u0026amp; vitality associated with youth. Mrutha Sanjīvanī, when applied, will bring back an old dead man’s body into a living old man. Restricting a person to his body is the pravrutti of Asuras. Amrit, when consumed, will ensure a youthful and disease-free body with dharmic disposition.\nSukrācārya and Brihaspati were rivals since they were sitting opposite in the fence of Asuras and Gods. Still Sukrācārya had the magnanimity in accepting Brihaspati’s son as his sishya (disciple). They were rivals since they were heading two opposite camps, but they had mutual respect towards their scholarship. A brahmin guru is ordained by dharma to teach (adhyāpanaṃ - अध्यापनं) when an अधिकारि(adhikāri) approaches him for education. Sukrācārya did not want to transgress his basic dharma.\nLaw code for Brahmins - The bad effects of intoxicating drinks is highlighted in the story. Sukrācārya is a Brahmin, and he experienced its ill effects. He wanted to set a law code for Brahmins to ensure moral standards in the society. Brahmins used to be the teachers in those days and they should be ideal for others to follow.\nyobrāhmaṇosdyaprabhṛtīha kaścit mohāt surāṃ pāsyati maṃdabuddhi: I apetadharmā brahmahā caiva sa syād asmiṃlloke garhitaḥ syāt pareca II – Adi Parva 76.67\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\npuruṣārthās- They are four as per Sanatana Dharma - Dharma, Artha, Kama \u0026amp; Moksha.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nउत्तांकोपाख्यानं, क्षीर सागर मथनं, सर्पयाग घट्टं (uttāṃkopākhyānaṃ, kṣīra sāgara mathanaṃ, sarpayāga ghaṭṭaṃ) - all these stories can be found in this same website as previous stories.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://example.org/posts/story16/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eKing Janamejaya heard the story of Samrat Bharata from Vysampayana and he was delighted to know the origin of Bharata Khanda.

The story of Sakuntala and king Dushyantha is a very popular story of Maha Bharata. The intellectual genius of women in ancient India, the brilliance of argumentative power, the superb negotiating skills are at once displayed for readers to understand many sociological and psychological issues of Indian society. 1\nBackground of the Story Vysampayana was in the court of Janamejaya on the advice of sage Vedavyasa to narrate the story of Kuru and Pandu brothers. Out of curiosity Janamejaya wanted to know as to how his vamsa was called Bharata Vamsa. Vysampayana began to narrate the story of Sakunthala and Dushyantha.\nSakunthala has been the subject matter many stories and ballads in the Indian history. Kalidasa, the famous dramatist of the 4th century AD had written a Sanskrit drama, Abhijñāna Sākuntalaṃ wherein he had introduced a variety of twists and turns to the theme to make it more attractive. But the current episode is based on Veda Vyasa’s depiction from Adi Parva of Maha Bharata.\nStory of Sakuntala \u0026amp; King Dushyanta There lived an emperor named Dushyantha in the Puru dynasty ruling from Hastinapura. He was a popular king and one day he went out to the forest for hunting. In the forest he saw the hermitage of sage Kanva Maharshi. He was quite thirsty, and he entered the hermitage to quench his thirst.\nTo his surprise he saw a beautiful young lady receiving him with all grace. She invited the guest with all honor and respect and with a shy in her face asked as to what she can do for him2. He was enchanted by her looks and appearance. He revealed his identity as the emperor of the earth and inquisitive to know her lineage. Sakunthala said that she was born to sage Viswamitra and the celestial Menaka 3. Instantaneously he expressed his love and his intention to marry her. She agreed but asked him to wait till the sage came back from his penance. But Dushyantha was eager to marry her. Since a marriage is permitted if both the bride and the groom are in consonance, he offered to take her as his wife by गांधर्व विवाह - Gāndharva vivāha 4. Sankuthala was hesitating as she was in the care of sage Kanva and wanted to get his permission. But Dushyantha said,\nआत्मनो बंधु रात्मैव गति रात्मैव चात्मनःI आत्मनो मित्र मत्त्रैव तथा त्मा चात्मनः पिता II आत्मैनात्मनो दानं कर्तु मर्हसि धर्मतः II – Adi Parva 73.7\n(‘You are your own relation. You are under your care. You are your own friend. You are your own father. As per dharma you can give away yourself to charity’ 5\nSince Gandharva was an accepted form of marriage, he persuaded her further and requested as to what he could do for her. Sakuntala was convinced with the logical and dharmic arguments and she put a condition that Dushyantha should make her son the heir apparent to the throne. Dushyantha agreed, and in no time the marriage was solemnized. He promised that he would send a royal entourage to the hermitage to take her in procession. Since he cannot stay there leaving the kingdom, he left for Hastinapura before the sage could arrive at the hermitage.\nAfter a few minutes, the sage returned to his Ashram and came to know about the marriage. Sakuntala was afraid of meeting the sage as she had transgressed swadharma (स्वधर्मात् स्खलिता भीता). Since both Dushyantha and Sakunthala happened to be Kshatriyas and Gandharva was permitted by Sastras, he blessed Sakunthala without any hesitation. क्षत्रियस्य हि गांधर्व: विवाहः श्रेष्ठ उच्यते I स कामया: स कामेव निर्मन्त्रो रहसि स्मृतःII – Adi Parva 73.27\n(A Kshatriya lady meeting the willing person out of her own will in a secret place and getting Gāndharva vivāha without mantras is acceptable as per dharma 6\nIn due course of time Sakunthala gave birth to a resplendent boy who was named Bharata. The boy was so brave that at the age of six, he could fight with lions, tigers and elephants and tame them with his might. Sakunthala was waiting for her husband to come and take her to the kingdom. But Dushyantha never turned up. Sage Kanva thought it fit to send Sakunthala to her husband’s house. He sent a few maids along with Sakunthala and she reached the palace of Dushyantha.\nShe introduced the boy to the emperor as his son and requested him to make him ‘Yuvraj’ (the heir apparent to the throne). Dushyantha pretended as if he had never seen her and refused to accept her as his queen. For a moment Sakunthala was shocked at the odd behavior of her husband and reminded of many sweet moments that they had in the hermitage and about their marriage. Still Dushyantha was reluctant to accept her.\nOn one side there was miserable distress and on the other side there was uncontrollable anger that enveloped her. She tried to invoke dharma by saying that there is an Atma inside as a witness for all human activities. ‘You are thinking that you are alone. In you, there is an Antaratma which is witnessing your sins’ 7. The sun, the moon, the wind, the water, the dharma – all are witness to a person’s merits and demerits. ‘Why are you behaving like an uncultured person? If you don’t take me back, your head will break into a hundred pieces’.\nSince there was no response from Dushyantha, she started invoking a few more dharmic points of argument. ‘A son is a disguised father. The husband enters into wife and born out of wife as a son. Hence wife is also known as jāya (जाय) 8.A son relieves the father and his forefathers from an exclusive ‘puth’ hell 9 as per sastras. That son has now reached your court and still you are neglecting him’.\nभार्या मूलं त्रिवर्गस्य भार्या मूलं तरिष्यतः – Adi Parva 74.41 (‘As per sastras, a wife is the queen of the house and without her no man in the stage of grihasta attains dharma, artha and kama 10). You cannot evade or disown your own wife.\nआत्मा आत्मनैव जनितः पुत्र इत्युच्यते बुधै: | तस्माद् भार्याम् नरः पश्येत् मातृवत्पु त्रमातरम् II – Adi Parva 74.48 (‘Since the husband’s replica develops in the womb of the wife, the wife should be given the respect of mother by the husband’ 11)\n‘A wife is regarded as half part of the man. Since rati (sensual pleasure), preeti (love \u0026amp; affection), and dharma are in the custody of a woman, no man should insult a woman even in anger’.\nThen Sakuntala started appealing to the emotional feeling of a man as a father. ‘In this world, even the ants want to preserve their progeny. The crows preserve the eggs of cuckoos with all care thinking that they are their eggs. The touch of the son gives such a pleasure to the father that no other touch including the touch of women can match it. While this is the fact you have now refused to take your son who has come to your place’.\n‘Hi, Maharaj! I belong to a great lineage. My father is a great sage Viswa Mitra and my mother, Menaka is an Apsarasa. I was born on the peaks of Himalayas, and I was nurtured initially by the birds and later by the great sage, Kanva. You had entered the hermitage where dharma, artha, and kama are in unison and married me as per dharma. You are the protector of the universe, and you cannot disown your own promises’.\nDushyanta was adamant and was not willing to accept Sakuntala. ‘You have been talking like a prostitute since you were born out of lust. I don’t even remember you’.\nSakuntala got enraged at the deceitful nature of her husband. ‘Afterall, why should he lie’? She said, वरं कूपशताद्वापी वरं वापीशताद्क्रतु: | वरं क्रतुशतात्पुत्र: सत्यं पुत्रशताद्वरं II 12 – Adi Parva 74.102\n(One water well is greater than a hundred stepped wells. One yagna is greater than a hundred sons. One Truth is greater than hundred sons.)\nSakuntala was not willing to accept the insult. ‘My birth is greater than your birth. I can freely move in the celestial worlds, but you can move only upon the earth. You are not a truthful person. My son can become the emperor of this universe even without you’, telling like this Sankuntala set out from the place.\nThen a voice from the sky pronounced the truth and asked Dushyanta to accept Sakuntala as she was a legally a wedded wife as per dharma. Everyone in the court felt very happy and Dushyanta came forward to take the hands of Sakuntala. ‘I also remember the whole truth and I know this boy as my son. But if I accept, the people at large may question my integrity and treat me an impure person’ 13. As a king I am responsible to my people’. Turning towards Sakuntala, he said, ‘I deliberately refused to accept you for people will treat you in bad light. If I accept the son and agree to make him heir apparent, the people at large think that I have agreed to your request out of lust 14. But in the bargain, I have hurt your feelings. Please excuse me’.\nDushyanta embraced his son, Bharata who later became the emperor and performed innumerable yagnas and yagas. Our country got the name Bharata desa in memory of this Bharata.\nVysampayana concluded the story of Sakuntala, and Janamejaya was delighted.\nPoints to Ponder The grand narrative of Mahabharata about women of ancient India is that women in general were quite educated and could argue with men invoking Dharma and Truth. They were adept in sastras by constantly listening to the dictums from their parents. Sakuntala is no exception to this rule. Women were allowed to choose their life-partners once they attain maturity. We have an ample number of examples in the characters of Sakuntala, the legendary Sāvitri, Draupadi, Ulūchi, Hidimba, Damayanthi etc. Sometimes, marriages were allowed even without Vedic chants (Gandharva marriage). The society was broadly liberal and allowed a decent, if not a free choice to ladies. The story highlights the importance of adhering to Truth (Satyam). Sakuntala, being truthful, has no hesitation in scolding her own husband in an open court when he transgressed Truth and Dharma. In one of the passages Sankuntala says, ‘the sun, the moon, the wind, the water, the dharma – all are witness to a person’s merits and demerits. Why are you behaving like an uncultured person? If you don’t take me back, your head will break into a hundred pieces’. Here she is referring to the Pancha bhutas out of which our physical bodies are made of. Initially she talks of ‘atma’ at the Vedantic/ spiritual level, and when Dushyantha refused to listen, she talks at the mundane level to make her argument more pointed. After all, she is a celestial lady, and he is mortal human being. The legendary Sanskrit dramatist, Kalidas has changed the story in Abhijñāna Sākuntalaṃ to depict the hero as ‘Dhirodatta’- the personification of all good qualities. The story of Sakuntala was sung by many poets, dramatists and in recent years the story was used by the filmmakers also. Mahabharata inspired generations of people and the roots of our culture are imbedded in Mahabharata. Brain Teasers/ Questions Do you think that women in ancient India were not intellectual enough to argue their point of view invoking dharma? Can we learn negotiating skills from the character of Sakuntala? What type of skills she has exhibited in this story? ‘Ancient Hindu society was quite liberal in the matters of marriage and other issues of civil code’ – justify. Sakuntala was hesitant to talk to Kanva about her marriage with Dushyantha fearing that she had transgressed Svadharma. What Swadharma she transgressed? Is a king (ruler of a State) responsible to his people in the matters of his personal life? Why? Does the psychology of men in dominating and disowning women changed over a period of seven thousand years? What is the cultural lineage of our society at large? What is the ethical dilemma of Dushyanta in accepting his legally wedded wife?

Eighteen Akshouhinis of warriors were destroyed in the Kurukshetra war fought between Pandavas and Kauravas. Such a destruction was planned much in advance in the court of Brahmaa to rid the Earth free from Adharmic forces. The story relies on the passages from Mahabharata and some Puranas to unravel the plan and the eventual birth of Gods and Asuras upon the earth. 1\nBackground of the Story On the advice of sage Vedavyasa, Vysampayana started narrating the story of Mahabharata in the court of Janamejaya. Janamejaya heard the story of Vedavyasa and asked as to why his forefathers indulged in a brutal war. Vysampayana started narrating the births chief warriors and the reasons for their birth upon the earth.\nAsuras \u0026amp; Their Plan Once upon a time the Gods performed a great Yagna running for hundreds of human years in the heaven. All Gods including the God of death, Yama participated in the event. There was no death upon the earth and the humans survived for hundreds of years. This was the occasion for Asuras to establish their supremacy upon earth. पाताळ लोक (pātāḻa loka ) was the abode of Asuras. While Gods were busy in the heaven, Asuras from pātāḻa loka started taking birth upon the earth in different kingly families, thereby destroying the dharmic equilibrium upon the earth.\nइह देवत्वमिच्छन्तः मानुषेषु मनस्विनः I\nजज्ञिरे भुवि भूतेषु तेषु तेष्वसुरा विभो II – Adi Parvam 64.29 2\n(Desiring the authority and lordship, the Asuras of esteem were born to human beings and other living creatures upon this earth).\nA few kings of Asuric background systematically started destroying Vedic traditions and began insulting even Maharshis. The mother Earth could not bear the weight of adharmic people. She went to the creator Brahmaa and poured out her grievance before him. On the advice of Lord Shiva, Brahmaa asked all the Gods to take births upon the earth as human beings to counter the rise of adharma. The God Vishnu agreed to the proposal of Brahmaa and he assured other Gods that he would also take birth upon the earth to re-establish dharma upon the earth.\nAṃśāvatāranam Ashtavasus 3 were the Gods, and they were cursed by sage Vasishta to be born upon earth as humans for their mischievous demeanour. They fell on the feet of the sage and begged pardon. He said, ‘I pardon the first seven of you with a little punishment, but the last person among you has to spend as a human being for longer years upon the earth’. The Astavasus have to now born in the womb of a human lady. By the time the river Ganga was coming down to earth for marrying a king. The Ashtavasus approached her and requested her that they be allowed to be born in her womb.\n‘But we request you to through us in the river immediately after our birth. We do not want to live long upon the earth. The last one will be your child and he shall live for long years. We shall bestow our tejas in him so that he will be the greatest warrior upon the earth’. She agreed and that is the reason for the birth of Bhishma.\nLord Vishnu was born to Devaki and Vasudeva. Bruhaspathi, the guru of Devas was Drona. The God of death, Yama took the form of Vidura. Durvāsa, the very incarnation of Lord Shiva initiated a powerful Mantra to Kunti and Kunti invited Lord Surya by invoking the Mantra. Lord Surya blessed Kunti with the great warrior Karna. According to Markandeya Purana, the tejas of Indra helped in the birth of all Pandavas by the Gods – God of Dharma devava, Vayu, \u0026amp; the twin Gods, Asvin brothers. Indra’s wife Sachi Devi took the form of Draupadi.\nDhritarashtra and Pāṇḍu Maharaj were born to Kshatriya queens with the blessings of Vedavyasa. Abhimanyu was the amsa of Chandra (Moon). Lord Siva and Yama blessed with their tejas and Asvatthama was born. Krupa, the brother-in-law of Drona was born from Rudra Gana tribe. Sakuni was born with Dvāpara amsa (Dvapara Yuga). Drupada and Kruthavarma were from Marudgana tribe of Gods. Agni, the God of fire took the form of Drushtadyumna. All the five Upa Pandavas 4 were Visvedevas.\nSri Krishna’s brother, Balarama was the amsa of the serpent God, Adisesha. Sanatkumara was born as Pradyumna. On the orders of Indra all the Apsara ladies were born as sixteen thousand Gopikas to become the wives of Sri Krishna. The Goddess Lakshmi was born as Rukmini. Two Goddesses Siddhi and Dhruthi took the form of Kunthi and Mādri.\nA Gandharva king by name Hamsa was born as Dhritarashtra as a blind person.\nJanamejaya was hearing the story with all keenness. He asked Vysampayana, ‘Oh Maharshi! It is very interesting to hear the background of my illustrious grandfathers. Please also tell me how the Rakshasas (loosely translated as demons) have taken their birth?’\nVysampayana started telling. ‘Oh king! There was a Rakshasa by name Viprachitti and he was born as Jarāsandha. Hiranyakasyapa who later incarnated as Rāvaṇa took the form of Siśupāla. The younger brother of Prahlāda, Samhrāda was born as Salya. Another brother of Prahlāda, Anuhrāda was born as Drushtakethu. The son of Narakāsura was Bhagadatta and he was the incarnation of an Asura by name Bāṣkala.\nThere was a terrible tribe of Asuras by name Krodhavasa. Ekalavya belonged to Krodhavasa tribe of Asuras. Kālanemi was born as Kamsa who plotted to kill Krishna many times. Kali Purusha was born as Duryodhana. All his ninety-nine brothers belonged to Asuras of Pulastya race.\nVysampayana said, ‘Oh King! I have told you the births of all important actors of Kurus and Pandavas’ and concluded the story of Aṃśāvatārana.\nJanamejaya was very happy and said, ‘Oh Sage! I am very much pleased and happy with the story. I also wish to know as to why our vamsa is known as Bharata Vamsa’. Vysampayana started narrating the story.\nPoints to ponder Some scholars like Purana Brahma Malladi Chandrasekhara Sastry opine that the eighteen days war was well planned by the trinity (Brahmaa, Vishnu and Mahesvara) to get rid of the weight of adharma upon the earth. They wanted to establish dharma in the society. Precisely this was the reason for sage Durvāsa (Isvara amsa) to visit the house of Kunthibhoja, the stepfather of Kunti. Durvāsa is known for anger, and for cursing others frequently. In the case of Kunthi, he blessed her and initiated a powerful mantra. She can command any God with this mantra and have a child with the God. Why did he give this mantra to a girl (not even of teenage) when she is still unmarried? This mantra is going to become harbinger for the birth of Karna who is squarely responsible for the war. Without him, Duryodhana would not have declared war. Thus, Shiva paved the plan, Brahmaa executed the plan by ordering Gods to born upon earth, and Vishnu become the prime actor and director of the Mahabharata war. The Kurukshetra war was a war between the forces of Dharma (Gods) and Adharma (Asuras). Eventually Gods came out victorious. A few Gods sat on the side of Adharma (Bhishma, Drona, Karna etc), but helped the Dharmic forces directly or indirectly. Duryodhana was the incarnation of Kali Purusha. Mahabharata war was fought almost at the end of Dvapara Yuga. Duryodhana who belonged to Dvapara Yuga firmly established the systems of Kali, and there is no doubt, his practices are being followed majority of people now.

The story heralds the birth of Vedavyasa who has written this great episode ‘Mahabharata’. Mahabharata is also known as Panchama Veda (the fifth Veda) since it discusses the nuances of Vedic dictums in easy and logical way for the sake of common populace. The stories of Mahabharata are illustrations to the great Vedic thoughts.\nThe story discusses Yashti Pravesam tradition which has been followed for many years in India by the kings at the time of coronation. 1\nBackground of the Story The sarpayāga of Janamejaya came to an and with the intervention of Rishi Aāstīka. By the same time Vedavyasa entered the court of Janamejaya. He was received with all reverence by the king and his deputies. Later Janamejaya requested sage Vedavyasa to narrate the entire story of his forefathers and the great conflict of Kurukshetra.\nVedavyasa looked at his disciple Vysampayana and ordered him to narrate the story in the court of Janamejaya. Everyone in the royal court was inquisitive to hear the Kuru heroes’ story and the eventual Kurukshetra war. Vysampayana started the narration.\nThe romance of Uparichara Vasu with Girika Once upon a time there lived a mighty king by name Uparichara Vasu (उपरिचर वसु ) ruling Chedi desa (the present day Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh). As he was very much inclined and interested in tapas, he renounced his kingdom and started doing tapas. The Gods were agitated as they could see the dharma declining in the absence of danda (the fear of king’s force) in his empire.\nThey approached the king and Indra said, ‘Oh king! In your absence, the people are falling prey to evil practices and adharma. You are my good friend upon the earth. I advise you to go back to your kingdom and establish dharma’. Then Indra presented an aeroplane made of crystal (which can fly in the air as per his wish) and Indramāla (a special garland by which he can attain extraordinary powers and can ward off the arrows). Indra also presented him a Venu Yashti (a special wooden stick which persecutes evil people and protect dharmic people).\nUparichara Vasu was very much pleased and obliged the advice of Indra. He erected a great platform and firmly fixed the Venu Yashti and performed a great puja in honour of Indra. On the orders of the king, the Yashti was decked with flower garlands and coconuts were offered. Indra was pleased by the offerings, and he declared, ‘From now on, kings who perform Yashti puja before ascending thrones shall rule their countries with peace and attain victories with ease’.\nHaving firmly placed in the kingdom, Uparichara Vasu used to roam in the air in his newly acquired aeroplane. One day he saw Suktimati (a small river) in deep trouble. Kolāhala, a mountain saw Suktimati and fell in love with her. He wanted to catch hold of Suktimati and obstructed her passage. The king came down and kicked Kolāhala with all force and saved Suktimati. But, by the time she became pregnant by the mountain and she delivered two children who, in no time, grew big and bowed to their mother, Suktimati. How can the river Suktimati take care of her children? She presented both of them to Uparichara Vasu. The son of Suktimati was made Senapathi (commandant of royal army) and the daughter, Girika became the wife of Uparichara Vasu.\nGirika was such a beautiful and romantic lady that she had bewitched the king, and the king could not leave her even for a moment. But alas! Before the king had his nuptial pleasure, there was a call from his father. His father ordered him to go to forest for hunting wild animals which had become a great menace to the populace. Uparichara Vasu had no choice. He left his darling in the house and set out to forest. It was spring season and the king saw the mating birds appear to mock at him.\nHe had arrows in the hands, but the mind was fixed to Girika. He was dreaming in the daytime without sleep, and he experienced retaḥskalanam (रेतःस्कलनम् – the semen discharge). He thought, ‘Let not my retas get wasted, nor my wife’s रितुकाल् (period of fertility)’. He collected his semen into a leaf bowl and sent it to his wife through an eagle.\nThe eagle was flying in the sky with the leaf bowl and encountered with another eagle trying to snatch away the leaf bowl. While they were fighting in the sky, the leaf bowl fell into a river and the retas got mixed into river water. A fish swallowed the semen and in due course of time gave birth to two children – one male and one female. The fish was none other than an apsara who was cursed for some reason by Lord Brahma to become a fish. She was relieved of her curse, and she left for her loka.\nThe king heard the news and picked up his two children. He gave the girl to Dāsarāju, the chief of fisher men tribe and asked him to nurture the child. Since the girl came out from the womb of a fish, her odour was that of a fish and people could feel her odour from a long distance. Dāsarāju named the girl as Satyavati but people use to call her as Matsyagandhi since her odour was that of a fish. The boy was made yuvarāj and eventually he became the king of Matsyadesa.\nSage Parāśara meeting Satyavati – the birth of sage Vedavyasa. Satyavati grew up in the fisherman house and by the time she became adolescent, she was exceptionally beautiful. She was assisting her father in navigating the boats across the river. One day she was alone in the boat and sage Parāśara requisitioned her services for crossing the river.\nWhile they were in the midst of the river, Parāśara could see her beautiful smiling face with all glean and glory. He could not control the pangs of love. He approached her and asked to fulfil his wish.\nसंगमं मम कळ्याणी कुरुष्वेत्यभ्यभाषत I साब्रवीत् पश्य भगवान् पारावारे स्थितान् ऋषीन् **II – Adiparva 63.72 2\n(‘Oh Lady! You fulfil my wish’, thus he expressed his desire. She said, ‘Hey Bhagavan! Look at those rishis sitting near the shore’).\n‘How can our union happen when many eyes are watching at us?’ Parāśara respected her sentiment and created a cloud of thick fog around the boat. It was suddenly dark, and she bent her head with shy.\n‘Hey Bhagavan! I am a virgin and under the control of my father. If my virginity is spoiled, how can I go home and show my face to my father?’ Parāśara blessed her and said, ‘You shall remain as a virgin, and it is my assurance. You can ask any other boon’.\nShe requested that she should be rid of the foul fish odour. Parāśara was happy to bless her with natural fragrance and from then onwards, her fragrance can be recognised by people for a yojana distance. She, thus, became Yojana Gandhi (Yojana is equivalent to 12 kilometers \u0026amp; Gandhi is lady with aroma).\nSatyavathi (Yojana Gandhi) was very happy, and she united with him with all feminine virtues. The union resulted in ‘sadyogarbham’ (the instantaneous birth of a child), and a boy was born. Immediately he grew into adulthood and set out to Himalayas for tapas. Since he was born in द्वीपं- dvīpaṃ, he was named as Dvaipāyana (later he was known as Vedavyasa). He promised his mother that he would appear before her whenever she wishes to see him.\nSatyavathi came back to her house and Dāsarāju was surprised at the aroma of his daughter.\n‘Oh father! Today I met with a rishi by name Parāśara. He is the son of sage Sakti who in turn is the son of great sage Vasishta. He blessed me with this fragrance’. Dāsarāju felt very happy at the turn of events.\nVedavyasa and his contribution Vedavyasa is the author and also an actor in Mahabharata. Mahabharata is called as Panchama Veda since it is equivalent to four Vedas in propagation and promotion of dharma. Dharma, Artha, Kāma and Moksha are elaborately discussed in this story in tune with Vedic philosophy. The chapters dealing with Bhagavad Gita, Sanatsujatiyam,Vidura Niti, Yaksha Prasnas, \u0026amp; Vishnu Sahasranama made Mahabharata an immortal work bequeathed by Vedavyasa to subsequent generations.\nधर्मेचार्थेच कामेच मोक्षेच भरतर्षभ यदिहास्ति तदन्यत्र यन्नेहास्ति न तत् क्वचित् – Adi Parva 62.53 3\n(Whatever is there in Mahabharata is there any where; and what is not hear is not anywhere).\nApart from Mahabharata, Vedavyasa also authored his magnum opus, BRAHMA SUTRAs and all the one hundred eight Puranas.\nHe is credited with dividing and classifying all Vedic mantras into four parts – Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda \u0026amp; Adharvana Veda. Due to this very reason, Dvaipāyana came to be known as Vedavyasa.\nThus, Vysampayana concluded the story of Veda Vyasa and proceeded to narrate the story of Mahabharata.\nPoints to Ponder Venu Yashti is a bamboo stick presented to Uparichara Vasu by Lord Indra. In this story we see that the king established it on high pedestal and performed puja. The practice of performing Yashti puja is a great tradition in kingly families. Great kings of Bharat used to perform Yashti puja before ascending to the thrones till kingship got into extinction after the advent of Independence. Virginity is one more important aspect of this story. How can the virginity remain sacred after the union with the partner? Gods and great rishis possess ashta siddis (eight divine powers) 4 by means of which they can perform supernatural things. वाचा दृष्ट्या तथा स्पर्शात्संघर्षणेति पंचधा\nमनुष्य धर्मोदैवेन धर्मेणहि नदुष्यति- Asramavasa Parvam, Mahabharatam\n(Gods and rishis can pregnant a lady by the power of their sankalpa,words,looks, touch and/or physical union – five ways of making a lady pregnant . Human dharma cannot become impure by Daiva dharma). The union of Parāśara with Satyavathi might be anyone of the first four ways. ‘Whatever is there in Mahabharata is there any where; and what is not hear is not anywhere’. This statement does not mean all modern sciences such as physics, chemistry, medicine etc. It should be construed that whatever existing knowledge of that time was available in the book of Mahabharata and one need not search for knowledge from anywhere.

The story discusses the process of Sarpayāgaṃ and the intervention of rishi Aāstīka to stop the destruction of the entire race of serpents. The story discusses Aāstīka tradition which has been followed for the last five thousand years in India \u0026amp; Aāstīka Stotram to obviate the fear from serpents. It also discusses the important purohits – Hotha, Udgāta, Adhvaryu and Brahma for conducting any yāgaṃ, and the tradition of which is being followed even now. 1\nAnother interesting tradition of worshipping snakes and cobras on the day of नागपंचमि (nāgapancami) can be traced to this story.\nBackground of the Story Janamejaya was the son of king Parikshit who was the illustrious grandson of Arjuna. Janamejaya was provoked by Uttanka to perform Sarpayāgaṃ (Story 8) to avenge the death of his father, Parikshit. The serpents were also cursed by their mother Kadru that they would die in the Sarpayāgaṃ. The serpents knew that the Sarpayāgaṃ would come to an end by the intervention of a rishi born to their sister Jaratkaru (Story 8); and not all serpents would perish in the holocaust.\nSaunaka was inquisitive to know the nuances of the Sarpayāgaṃ and how it was prevented by rishi Aāstīka. Ugrasrvasa started narrating the story.\nThe great Holocaust Janamejaya was very angry that his innocent father was killed by Takshaka. He also learnt from Uttanka that Takshaka even prevented a brahmin physician, Kāśyapa from giving treatment to his father. He decided to destroy the entire race of serpents in a Vedic ritual, and he consulted his purohits to suggest a yāgaṃ. After deliberations, the ministers suggested him to perform Sarpayāgaṃ.\nUpon the orders of the king, the ritviks started preparing the yajña vāṭikā (यज्ञ वाटिका, the altar upon which the yagna has to be performed). The land was measured, and bricks were arranged as per the śāstrās. While the process was going on, a vāstu śāstra śilpi (a sculptor of vāstu śāstra knowledge) 2 of sūta caste 3 declared that there would be an obstacle for the yagna, and all serpents would not perish as the yagna would get stopped by an unknown brahmin. He suggested that the timing of the yagna preparation was not conducive for its logical conclusion. Janamejaya got angry and ordered his people not to entertain any unknown person without his permission into the yajña vāṭikā.\nThe yagna started with the invocation of Vedic chants and the lighting of the fire. Rishi Chanḍabhārgava agreed to be the Hotha. Rishi Kautsa was the Udgāta, and two rishis Jaimini \u0026amp; Shārangarava officiated as Brahmas and rishi Pingala became Adhvaryu 4.The other rishis who graced the occasion happened to be Vedavyasa, Narada, Devala, Atreya, Sruthasrava and the like.\nAmid Vedic chants the officiating priests were calling aloud the names of the serpents, and under the spell of mantras, the serpents were running towards the yajña vāṭikā and jumping into the fire, only to be get scorched into ashes. When thousands and thousands of serpents were getting burnt, Takshaka (the one which had bitten Janamejaya’s father) got afraid ran towards the place of Indra and sought asylum. Indra blessed him that he would be saved from the holocaust. He asked Takshaka to stay in Indra loka under his patronage.\nThe Deliberations Meanwhile the eldest of the serpents, Vasuki got perturbed and reached out to his sister Jaratkaru. He said, ‘My dear sister! You are aware of Janamejaya’s Sarpayāgaṃ. Thousands of serpents are being killed on the fire altar. I am worried about the possibility of the extinction of our race. But there is a ray of hope. As per the divine plan 5, the Sarpayāgaṃ will come to an end with the intervention of your son, Rishi Aāstīka. Can you request him to go to Janamejaya’s court and stop the holocaust?’\nJaratkaru agreed and asked her son Aāstīka to go to the court of Janamejaya and impress upon the king of the necessity of stopping the Sarpayāgaṃ.\nAāstīka’s persuasion and the end of Sarpayāgaṃ Aāstīka reached the yajña vāṭikā but the gate keepers obstructed his entry. Then he stood outside the gates and started praising Janamejaya, the purohits, the attendant rishis and the yajna. Everyone inside could hear the resonant Stotra sung by the rishi outside. Janamejaya was inquisitive to know who the rishi was! He ordered his servants to allow the rishi inside to the arena of yajña vāṭikā.\nAāstīka pronounced the swasti vachaka (good omen) to the king and said, ‘Oh king! The yagna which you are performing equals the Varuna yagna and Indra yagna in stature. You are the very Indra upon this earth and your people are safe under your benevolent rule’.\nJanamejaya was very much pleased with the pious words of the rishi, and he was ready to fulfil any of his wish. He said, ‘Oh Rishi! We are all very much pleased by your Stotra in praise of all of us. Please ask any wish and I shall bestow the same upon you’. Before Aāstīka could talk anything, the Hotha came up to the king and said, ‘Oh king! We have been calling Takshaka but we are told that he was being firmly protected by Indra. Without his death, the objective of the yagna would be defeated. You can fulfil the wish of this rishi after we see Takshaka’s physical presence here’.\nJanamejaya felt uneasy that Takshaka was being protected by Indra. He goaded the officiating priests to invoke mantras and call Indra with Takshaka to the fire altar. The priests now started calling Indra with Takshaka. The power of mantras was such strong that Indra could not stay in his place even for a minute. He was rushing towards the fire altar with Takshaka in his hand. Everyone could see Indra in the firmament straight above the yagna vāṭikā. Indra was scared and threw Takshaka to the sky and left to his place. The fear-wreck Takshaka reached just above the yagna vāṭikā and he was ready to jump into the fire.\nJanamejaya’s boon to Aāstīka The purohits said, ‘Oh king! Our wish is getting fulfilled. Takshaka is now under our spell and by our next chanting he would rush into the fire, and he would die. Now you can bestow any boon to the rishi. The king was in happy mood, and looking towards Aāstīka he said, ‘Oh Rishi! Your arrival is good omen for us. Now I wish to grant any boon. Please tell me what you wish to take from me’.\nAāstīka was very happy he said, ‘Oh king! You are a great king, and you abide by your words. My wish is that you please stop the yagna and save the race of serpents. Let no serpent die in the holocaust from this very moment’.\nJanamejaya pleaded with Aāstīka to choose any other wish, but Aāstīka was reluctant to agree. A righteous king was not supposed to go back on his words and transgress the moral standards of the day. The king consulted with his ministers and purohits and they suggested the king to honour his own words and bestow the boon upon Aāstīka. Janamejaya, with a happy tone, praised Aāstīka and said, ‘Let your wish be fulfilled. Let no serpent die in this Sarpayāgaṃ from this very moment. Let Takshaka also be freed from the spell of Mantras’.\nJanamejaya distributed enormous wealth to people and all other dignitaries who had attended the Sarpayāgaṃ. He also felicitated Aāstīka and bid farewell to him.\nAāstīka was a happy person for he became instrumental in preventing the death of serpent race in the holocaust. All serpents including Vasuki and Takshaka surrounded him in joy and praised him. They said, ‘Oh Great Rishi Aāstīka! ‘We are very much pleased with you, and we want to give back any boon of your choice. Please ask any boon’. Aāstīka was a rishi, and he did not want anything quid pro quo, but when they insisted, he said, ‘Well! I will ask a boon from you. Let there not be any fear to human beings who just remember the anecdote of Sarpayāgaṃ. If a person is encountered with a serpent and the person pronounces the following verse, the serpent should leave way for him. If any serpent transgresses the promise, let its head blead hundred cuts’.\nसर्पापसर्प भद्रं ते गच्छ सर्प महाविष I जनमेजयस्य यज्ञान्ते आस्तीक वचनं स्मर II (Adi Parva 58.25) 6\n(Oh, great serpent! Please go away from me. Remember the words of Aāstīka at the end of Janamejaya’s Sarpayāgaṃ) Vasuki was happy at this gesture of Aāstīka.\nPoints to ponder The story of Sarpayāgaṃ is a popular story in Itihasa literature. In Mahabharata times, the land- forest ratio was heavily skewed in favour of the later. The serpents, like cruel animals, used to prowl upon villagers and it was the duty of the king to protect the people from their onslaught. Sarpayāgaṃ was an invention by the Vedic priests to sacrifice the serpents and save the people.\nThe Sarpayāgaṃ was stopped at the behest of Aāstīka and this day is being celebrated as Nadivardhini Panchami (śrāvaṇa śukla paṃcami). This day happens to be the festival of nāgās (serpents) since their lives were saved by Aāstīka 7 People across Bharath celebrate this festival by offering milk, sweets and flowers and propitiate the serpents. The traditional roots of modern Bharath are firmly established in Mahabharat.\nAāstīka tradition – In the traditional houses of rural Bharath, we find this Aāstīka tradition. The villagers use to write name ‘Aāstīka’ on the outer doors with the belief that no snake dares to enter the house on seeing the name of their saviour. This tradition is however slowly getting outdated as people do not know the Mahabharath story of Janamejaya and about Sarpayāgaṃ.\nUgrasravasa concluded the story and said, ‘Oh rishis! I have started narrating the story of Mahabharat but on your request I deviated the subject matter to clear some of your doubts’. Saunaka said, ‘We are happy to hear Amrita Mathanam and Janamejaya’s Sarpayāgaṃ from you. Now you please start the main story of the Kuru warriors – Kauravas and Pandavas’. Ugrasravasa started narrating the story of Mahabharat. (We will read this in our next story series).\nThis Story is taken from Adi Parvam of Mahabharata (Gita Press, Gorakhpur)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVāstu śāstra – Vastu Shastra was developed by our ancient rishis around 4000 years ago.

Garutmantha or Garuda is the trusted devotee and the vehicle of Lord Vishnu. The story discusses the birth of Garutmantha and his expeditions. ‘Madhu Vidya’ (the art of inhaling Sun’s rays as substitute for food, spiritual quotient of darbha grass, and incubation of children in ghee pots etc are certain highlights of this story. 1\nBackground of the Story Saunaka was happy to hear the story of क्षीर सागर मथनं- kṣīra sāgara mathanaṃ and the birth of the divine horse Uchhaisrva in the process of churning of the ocean. He also heard Vinatha becoming the dasi of Kadruva and the birth of Anura. He was inquisitive to know as to how Vinatha got extricated from the bondage of Kadru. Saunaka started narrating the story.\nStory of Garutmantha Vinatha became jealous at the happiness of Kadru who was happily playing with her serpent sons. Out of eagerness she broke open one of her eggs. There she found half grown child with no thighs. The boy was very angry at her mother and cursed that she would become the slave of Kadru. Since he had no thighs, he was called as Anura, who later became the charioteer of Sun God, Surya. He saw his mother weeping at his curse. Out of affection and compassion he said, ‘You shall be the slave of Kadru and you will be relieved of bondage by your second son, Garutmantha. You preserve the second egg till a strong boy emerges out of it’.\nAfter a wait of more than five hundred years, the second egg automatically broke open and a huge eagle with a pair of broad wings fluttered out of the egg with a big bang. He was none other than Garutmanta (the eagle king) and immediately after his birth he rose to the Sun to demonstrate his might. All Gods bowed to the king of birds and made friendship with him.\nOne day when Garutmanta was with her mother Vinata, Kadruva called her aloud and asked her to take her (Kadruva) to the seacoast. Vinata took her over her back and Garutmanta took a few serpents over his back, and they obliged the request of Vinata 2. After a while the serpents asked Garukmanta to take them to beautiful places of interest. Garutmanta was disgusted for a while and asked Vinata as to why they had to perform all the jobs of the serpents and their mother. ‘Since I have been defeated in a bet, I had become a slave for Kadruva’, Vinata lamented.\nGarutmanta felt very bad and asked the serpents. ‘Please tell me what all you want for redeeming my mother from slavery and I will do the favor for you’. Serpents were very happy, and they asked the celestial nectar (amṛta) which would eventually immortalize the serpents. Garutmanta agreed to the deal. He defeated the Gods including Indra in a battle and took possession of the nectar. The greatness of Garutmanta lied not in possessing the nectar but in not consuming even a drop of it even though it was very much in its hands. Lord Vishnu was pleased with the nonchalant detachment displayed by the eagle and appeared before him 3. Eventually he became the vāhana (vehicle) for Vishnu. Vishnu blessed him that he would become immortal even without the nectar.\nWhen Indra failed to rescue the nectar from the hands of Garutmanta he sought his friendship and appealed not to give the nectar to venomous serpents. He feared that it would invite trouble for the people on earth. Dangerous people deserve destruction, let alone toleration. Garutmanta suggested that it was up to Indra to take over the pot of nectar after it was handed over to serpents.\nAs planned, he reached the serpents and put the nectar over the darbha grass and asked the serpents to have it after a bath. The serpents were pleased to release his mother from slavery. They rushed to take a bath and by which time Lord Indra descended from heaven and took off the nectar pot. The serpents desperately searched for the nectar and out of greed started licking the darbha grass. The sharp grass pierced their tongues into two pieces, and it is said that serpents had acquired two tongues from that time. Darbha grass attained sacredness since the heavenly nectar was kept over it. Even now it is a tradition to use darbha grass for majority of religious rituals in India.\nSmall episodes connected to the main story of Garutmanta We come across two small episodes connected to the main narrative. Indian tradition believes that the person who reads or hears this story including these small episodes shall attain the heaven. Let us see these small episodes also in a nutshell.\nBefore embarking on the great task of defeating the Gods, Garutmanta sought the blessings of his mother and asked her to suggest some food which could give him enough strength. ‘Oh son! In the midst of the ocean, there is a village inhabited by hunters. You eat all those hunters to get enough strength. Let the Sun and Moon protect your back. Let the Vayu (wind god) protect your wings. Let the fire god protect your face. Let the eight celestial Vasus protect the entire body’. Garutmanta followed the advice of his mother and gulped all hunters.\nStill, he was hungry. He went to his father, Kasyapa, sought his blessings and asked for food. ‘Oh son! Let all Vedas give you enough strength. Please go to the pond that can be seen from here. There an elephant on land and a wild tortoise in water have been fighting for years with a lot of hatred and anger. You eat those two animals and get enough strength to fight with the Gods.\nGarutmanta inquisitively asked, ‘Father! Why are they fighting with each other?’\nStory of the Tortoise and the Elephant Kasyapa narrated a story of their previous births thus: ‘Once upon a time there lived a Rishi by name Vibhavasa who was always angry with everyone. He used to keep all the money as joint property and was never willing to give the dues of his brother. Supratika, his brother wanted the division of property. Vibhavasa advised, ‘The property should not be divided. Our real enemies appearing as our common well-wishers interfere in our internal affairs and destroy both of us. Even dharma suggests that the elder brother should treat his younger brother as son; and the younger brother should treat his elder brother as father’ 4. But Suprateeka did not agree. Vibhavasa got angry and cursed his younger brother to be born as an elephant in the following birth. Suprateeka also cursed his brother to be born as a wild tortoise. Thus, brothers have been fighting for years with old animosities. You eat both of them’.\nGarutmanta reached the pond and picked both the elephant and the tortoise with its two legs and flew into the air. He was searching for a place to keep both of them before eating. He found a huge branch of a tree protracting some hundred yojana length and perched upon it. Immediately the branch broke and was about to fall.\nStory of Vālakhilya (वालखिल्य) Rishis When the branch of the tree was about to fall, Garutmanta noticed a few rishis hung upside down from the branch of the tree. They were none other than vālakhilya Rishis who were doing penance with all perseverance, and they should not get killed. Garutmanta immediately caught hold of the branch with his beak, and unable to know what to do, flew into the air and reached the abode of his father. When he was flying over the rivers and mountains, everyone including the Gods surprised at the strength of the eagle. Even the rishis were amazed at this extraordinary feat. Kasyapa saw his son coming towards his direction and prayed vālakhilya rishis to bless his son and not to get angry with him. ‘Garutmanta has embarked on a task for the benefit of the people at large’. He added, ‘Vālakhilya Rishis knew Madhu Vidya 5 and they live by drinking the rays of the sun’. The rishis were pleased and came down from the branch of the tree branch. Garutmanta dropped the branch over the mountains and then ate both the elephant and the wild tortoise who were all the time under the grip of his nails.\nWith sustained physical energy and with the blessings of his parents the mighty eagle made its destiny drawn much before it reached the gates of heaven.\nPoints to Ponder Careful analysis of the story reveals the meticulous preparation (in modern parlance- the strategy) for defeating the Gods. A task of this nature cannot be accomplished without the blessings of parents. Garutmantha is approaching his mother and then father before embarking for his great task. We need to carefully read the words used by Ved Vyasa to understand the minds of parents. Mother blesses that different gods protect different limbs of her son. He is going to fight Gods, and his mother invokes Gods and seeks that the same Gods must protect him. Kasyapa invokes four Vedas and blesses that they should protect him. Vedas stand for Eternal Truth and the cause for which Garutmanta has set out is a noble one- that is redress the wrong done to his mother.\nAfter getting spiritual prowess from the blessings, Garutmanta seeks physical prowess. The story emphasizes the importance of both physical and spiritual powers.\nGarutmantha was advised by his mother not to eat Brahmins while eating Nishadas. Why? In Maha Bharata, a Brahmin is described as one who has Brahma Jnana (ब्रह्म ज्ञानेन ब्राह्मणः - brahma jñānena brāhmaṇaḥ). A Brahmin who lives on alms and spreads the message of wisdom needs to be respected in the society. Garutmanta ate all Nishadas since they are hunters who kill animals for their day today existence.\nGarutmanta wanted to save vālakhilya rishis since they have extraordinary spiritual powers and Kasyapa was seen saying that they knew Madhu Vidya and they can sustain lives by drinking the rays of the sun. The Madhu Vidya is vividly described in Upanishads. Modern scientists need to do detailed research on the scientific applicability of this sacred knowledge for sustaining and preserving the depleting natural resources and preserves the planet for future generations to enjoy.\nThe story exemplifies the nobility of Garutmanta. He has in his hands the celestial nectar that can immortalize him. He could have drunk it, and he could have given it to his mother also. But he never intended to use it for a selfish cause. He was not interested that it should reach bad people on earth also. He did his act with discriminating intellect and acted as per the Gita dictum which says:\nप्रवृत्तिंच निवृत्तिं च कार्याऽकार्ये भयाऽभये | बन्धं मोक्षं च या वेत्ति बुद्धि: सा पार्थ सात्विकी || 18. 30||\n(pravṛttiṃca nivṛttiṃ ca kāryā’kārye bhayā’bhaye | bandhaṃ mokṣaṃ ca yā vetti buddhi: sā pārtha sātvikī)\n(that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what is binding and what is liberating, that understanding is established in the mode of goodness - translation taken from Swamy Prabhu Pada).\nFinally, either in Maha Bharata or Valmiki Ramayana we find a concept pf Phala Sruti (phala śṛti- फल शृति) which means the reading/ listening of a particular story shall give certain spiritual or temporal results. This Phala Sruti will be there only for exceptional stories. Why? Traditional Hindus believe that the slokas in the story are packed with powerful sounds/ intonations (बीजाक्षरं – bījākṣaraṃ) that give fruitful results. For example, for a quick marriage of daughter, the father has to recite selected few slokas from the episode of Rukmini Kalyanam (Rukmini’s marriage with Krishna) of Bhagavata. There is also a belief that the rendition of Virata Parva on the tank beds shall result in rain. For the story of Garutmanta also Phala Sruti is given by Ved Vyasa that the readers and listeners shall attain heavens after their demise.\nTradition and Science Much research has already been done on the efficacy of darbha grass. Traditional Hindus even now keep this darbha grass over food items during eclipses. Darbha is considered celestial since Garutmantha had kept the pot of amrit (nectar) over it to propitiate the serpents. It is strange that the traditions of this nature have passed over centuries in India that it is one of the strong reasons for our culture could withstand the onslaughts of plethora of invasions across the country. Major civilizations across the world eclipsed but our civilization withstood the calamities.\nThis story is taken from Adi Parva of Maha Bharata (Gita Press, Gorakhpur) written by sage Ved Vyasa.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nततः सुपर्ण माता तामावहत्सर्प मातरम्। पन्नगान्ग रुडश्चापि मातुर्वचन चोदितः।। – Adi Parva 25.5 tataḥ suparṇa mātā tāmāvahatsarpa mātaram। pannagān garuḍaścāpi māturvacana coditaḥ।।\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nविष्णुना च तदाकाशे वैनतेयः समेयिवान्। तस्य नारायणस्तुष्टः तेनाऽलौल्येन कर्मणा।। – Adi Parva 33.12 viṣṇunā ca tadākāśe vainateyaḥ sameyivān। tasya nārāyaṇastuṣṭaḥ tenā’laulyena karmaṇā।।\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nकनिष्ठान् पुत्रवत् पश्येत् ज्येष्ठो भ्रात्रा पितुस्समः (kaniṣṭhān putravat paśyet jyeṣṭho bhrātrā pitussamaḥ ) - (Neelakanta vyakhya on Maha Bharata)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMadhu vidya - This knowledge is vividly mentioned in Bruhadaranyaka and Chandagyopanishad.

Deva-Asura sangrama or the war between the gods and demons is a very popular story that we come across in many Puranas and Itihasas. The story is the subject matter of many folk songs, ballads and of late, films. The churning of the ocean and resultant war appeals to all types of readers from children to highly learned intellectuals. The symbolism behind the story is for the consumption of intellectuals and the story, per se, is for children. 1\nBackground of the Story Saunaka was happy to hear the story of Vinata and Kadruva. But he was inquisitive to know the story of क्षीर सागर मथनं- kṣīra sāgara mathanaṃ (Churning of the Ocean of Milk). Ugrasravasa started telling the story to Saunaka and his ten thousand disciples.\nDevas were contemplating on a plan to attain ‘amrita’ or nectar, the drinking of which will result in eternal youth and victory over death. Vishnu suggested that they should take the help of Asuras (demons) and churn the Ocean of Milk2. But how anyone can churn such a huge ocean? With the help of Anatha (one of the mighty serpent sons of Kadru) they plucked the mountain Mandhara and dipped it into the ocean. Vishnu came in the form of Kurma3 (the celestial tortoise) and stood in the ocean bed to ensure that the mountain does not sink totally into the waters. Then they brought Vasuki, the long serpent and used it as the churning rope and swirled it around the mountain.\nDevas took the side of tail and Asuras took the side of the head of the Vasuki and they churned the ocean for thousand years. Suddenly there was terrible smoke which engulfed the entire place. They observed a deadly poison (halahalam) flowing out of the ocean. Unable to bear the brunt of it, they approached Lord Siva who took the entire poison and gulped, and upon the advice of his wife Parvati, kept it in his neck (kanta). From that day he was known as Neelakanta (a person with a black neck).\nThe churning continued and the Moon God (Chandra) emerged out of the ocean. After Chandra, the Goddess of wealth Lakshmi emerged out of the ocean, and she married Lord Vishnu. Vishnu also took Kaustubha, the celestial gem that emanated out of the ocean. The Kamadhenu (a celestial cow that gives whatever is desired), a celestial elephant (Iravata) and a celestial horse (Uchhaisrava)- and all were taken by Indra. Thousands of celestial ladies (apsarasas) also came out of the ocean and adorned the court of Indra. Later, the God of Ayurveda, Dhanvantari emerged. He was carrying the pot of Amrita (nectar).\nThere was scramble for Amrita and cries of ‘it is mine’, ‘it is mine’ ripped the entire air. The Asuras snatched the Amrita Kalasa from the hands of Dhanvantari and ran away to a great distance. Now, they had started quarrelling among themselves for the nectar. Devas were watching the Asuras fighting among themselves.\nSuddenly Vishnu took the form of an enchanting lady (Mohini avatara) and attracted the demons. They were lured by the beautiful lady and started encircling her. She was smiling at everyone and engaged all of them to dance to her tunes. They thought that she was the most sagacious lady, and she would distribute the nectar judiciously. They handed over the nectar to her for distribution. While seeing the sensual delight, they forgot their discriminating intellect. Mohini arranged the Gods and Asuras in two rows and distributed the entire nectar to the gods.\nOne Asura, Rahu realized what was really happening on the stage and sat in the row of Gods disguising himself as a God. He took the nectar but before the nectar could go below the throat, Mohini (Lord Vishnu) cut off Rahu and his torso became lifeless whereas the head survived. Rahu was angry at the Sun and the Moon for they were the persons who alerted Lord Vishnu that he was an Asura. From that day he owed to devour the Moon (Lunar Eclipse) and the Sun (Solar Eclipse).\nBy the time the Asuras realized their foolishness the Gods devoured the nectar and became invincible. The Asuras fought with all force and a great battle ensued. Mohini turned back into Vishnu and killed thousands of Asuras with his powerful Chakra. The Asuras were defeated, and the Gods became victorious.\nPoints to Ponder What is the symbolic significance of the story? - On the face of it, it looks as though the Gods have deceived the Asuras. Having taken their help in churning the ocean, they denied the fruits of their labour to the demons. This story appears both in Maha Bharath, Valmiki Ramayana and in Puranas. For this, we need to understand the purpose of writing Itihasas and Puranas by the Rishis.\nThe purpose of Puranas and Itihas is to explain subtle thoughts of Vedanta in an elaborate form for common people. If Vedas can be understood by only a few wise people, Puranas and Itihasas are written for common people. Each character and each and every episode has specific symbolic meaning. The text of Purana is only a pretext to explain vedantic thoughts.\nThe good/ refined thoughts in our mind are represented by devas. The commentators on scriptures define devas as ‘देवाः शास्त्रोद्भासित इंद्रिय वृत्तय: असुराः तद्विपरीताः’ (‘devāḥ śāstrodbhāsita iṃdriya vṛttaya: asurāḥ tadviparītāḥ’) which means our thoughts purified by scriptures are gods; and the cruel, devilish, ugly and unrefined thoughts represent asuras. ‘असुषु रमन्ते इति असुराः’ (‘asuṣu ramante iti asurāḥ’)-which means those who dwell in sensual pleasures are Asuras. Our mind is compared to ocean where good and bad thoughts always fight. This is ‘मंथनं’- manthanam or clash of ideas or churning of ideas. One should support the good thoughts (devas) and deny support to bad thoughts (asuras).\nIn Valmiki Ramayana, the story starts with the description of the qualities of devas and asuras by saying that the Asuras were very strong and mischievous whereas Devas were strong and were in righteous path 4. Asuras, thus represent tamas and the devas represent rajas. The victory of rajas over tamas signifies the right path upon which a man should traverse in his life.\nThe second thing one should understand is that the Gods and Asuras are not persons but represent a quality. Any person of any varna can have purified thoughts representing devas; or cruel and wicked thoughts represented by asuras. Again, these qualities are not castes as a few understand today. A bramhin/ kshatriya/ vysya or sudra (by birth) can be deva or asura depending on his thoughts. In our scriptures many characters like Hiranya Kasyapa, Ravana, Kumbhakarna, Vrittasura etc are Bramhins but by virtue of their quality of thoughts they are Asuras. If demonic forces are encouraged, there will be unrighteousness in the world disturbing the equilibrium of the world.\nIn Gita Krishna tells that whenever there is an ascendency of adharmic forces, he shall incarnate upon the earth to destroy the evil forces5. The war of Gods and Asuras are the war of good and bad thoughts in our mind. The story seeks its reader to entertain, encourage and enthuse good thoughts all the time.\nThe story is taken from Adi Parva of Maha Bharata, Balakanda of Ramayana and from a few other Puranas.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAccording to legend there are seven Oceans- लवण इक्षु सुरा सर्पि दधि क्षीर जलार्णवाः (lavaṇa ikṣu surā sarpi dadhi kṣīra jalārṇavāḥ) - salt sea, sugarcane juice sea, sura (an intoxicating drink), sea of honey, sea of curd, sea of milk and sea of pure water.

The effects of anger and jealousy are the subject matter of this story. Anger results in delusion and fails the intellect of any person. The story discusses dāsī system (slavery) prevalent in ancient societies and tries to compare this system that was prevalent in Bharath vis-à-vis the West. The prevalence of the practice of preserving eggs in ghee pots for incubation is an ingenuous scientific technique unique to Indian society; and this aspect is also covered in the current story. 1\nBackground of the Story Saunaka heard the story of Jaratkaru from Ugrasrava and that he had a doubt as to why the serpents were cursed by their own mother. He asked Ugrasrava to narrate the story of Kadru or Kadruva, the mother of all serpents. Ugrrasrava started telling the story.\nVinata and Kadruva were the two wives of Kasyapa Prajapati. Both the queens approached Kashyapa and sought his blessings for children. As requested by them Kasyapa had given a blessing that Kadruva would have a thousand mighty sons and Vinata would have two mightier children. Both wives conceived and Kadruva had given birth to a thousand eggs and Vinata had given birth to two eggs.\nAs Kasyapa advised, the eggs were preserved in special ghee pots (as an act of incubation) and after five hundred years, thousand mighty serpents came out of thousand eggs. Kadruva was elated. Vinata was depressed and she waited for some more years and out of desperation and jealousy, she broke one of her eggs into pieces. It was strange and she found a well-built and strong muscled boy but without thighs and legs. The half-grown boy was very angry at his mother for her impatience and cursed her that she would become the slave of Kadruva for five hundred years.\nThe boy, after a while composed himself and said, ‘Mother! Don’t get depressed. Preserve the second egg for another five hundred years. A mighty boy shall emerge and rescue you from slavery’. The half-grown boy was named as aṇūra (अणूर) since ūru (ऊरु) in Sanskrit means thigh and since he had no thighs his name was Aṇūra - a man without thighs. Later, he became the charioteer of lord सूर्य (the sun god) and protected the earth from the scorching heat of the sun by shielding his back as a protective umbrella.\nAfter a few years both queens went out for a happy ride near the seacoast. There they saw Uchhaisrava, the celestial horse that emerged in क्षीर सागर मथनं- kṣīra sāgara mathanaṃ (Churning of the Ocean of Milk) from a very long distance. Vinata was amazed at the total white complexion of the horse. Kadruva did not agree with Vinatha and said that it was not totally white. They bet over the color of the horse; and the one who would be defeated should become the slave for the other. Since it was almost sunset, they both returned to their homes.\nKadruva summoned all her sons and requested them to encircle the tail of the horse to make it appear black. The sons were reluctant to perform an unrighteous task to save their mother. Kadruva did not want to become a slave and so she cursed her reluctant sons that they would be destroyed in the ‘सर्पयाग- sarpayāga’ (the sacrificial fire to annihilate the serpents) to be performed by the king Janamejaya in future. The serpents shuddered with fear and Karkotaka (one of the sons) agreed to accomplish the task of her mother and on the following day, he encircled the tail of Uchhaisrava to make it appear partially black. Vinatha, on seeing the celestial horse partially black, conceded her defeat and became the दासी - dāsī or slave of Kadru. Karkotaka approached her mother Kadru and begged her to suggest a remedy for her curse.\nKadruva became calm and suggested that one pious Rishi by name Astika will be born to her daughter Jaratkaru and for that the serpents have to search for a groom of same name, Jaratkaru. The boy born to both Jaratkarus would stop the sarpayāga and save the serpent community from being extinguished totally.\nAll gods were happy at the turn of events since the curse of Kadruva would sure destroy majority of the venomous serpents who were harmful to society at large.\nSaunaka was happy to hear the story of Vinata and Kadruva. But he was inquisitive to know the story of क्षीर सागर मथनं- kṣīra sāgara mathanaṃ (Churning of the Ocean of Milk).\nPoints to ponder The effects of anger and jealousy are the subject matter of this story. Vinatha was blessed by her husband that she would have two strong children and for that she has to wait with patience till the eggs were broken on their own. She knew very well that her husband’s words cannot go wrong. When Kadru gave birth to a thousand serpent sons, Vinatha became impatient and started developing jealousy. Out of impatience and jealousy she had broken one of her two eggs. A little more patience would have helped her in having a mighty son. Secondly, anger results in delusion and fails the intellect of any person. In the story we find Kadruva cursed her own children when they refused to obey her orders. She was unrighteous and yet she cursed them that they would get destroyed in sarpayāga.\nThe story discusses dāsī system which is loosely translated into English as slavery. Was it prevalent in ancient India? How rigorous was it? How was the slavery of India different from that of other countries? Let us discuss the issue very briefly.\nOnce Vinata became the dāsī of Kadruva, Kadruva ordered Vinatha to carry her on her back; and Garukmanta, the son of Vinatha was asked to attend to attend the errand works of the serpents. From this we come to know the ill treatment meted out to slaves. We also come to know that slavery was there in the ancient world, and it was again hereditary in western countries. But the slavery in India is upon consent and for a cause. It was not by violence and force. In another episode Sarmishta became slave to Devayani lest the Guru Sukracharya desert the asuras (demons). So, she agreed for a cause. Dharmaraja bet his brothers and wife and became a slave to Duryodhana in the first game of dice because it was on his volition he agreed to the terms and conditions of the game, and he never wanted to go away from his words. Vinata lost the bet with Kadruva and she agreed to become a slave.\nWhen we compare the slavery in Africa or in America or in Ancient Greece, we find that it was based on force and at the tip of the gun point. Again, there was no evidence of any slave getting relief from slavery. On the other hand, in India, the so-called slaves could extricate themselves out of slavery and became free people. Serious and inquisitive readers may see a book ‘The History of Torture throughout the Ages’ by George Ryley Scott, Luxor Press, London) for comprehensive understanding the system of slavery in ancient ages.\nThe story talks about preserving the eggs in ghee pots for incubation. We have plenty of references of this sort in the birth of Drona, Krupa and Agastya etc. Is this just a myth or is any underlying scientific proposition existing? A few decades back, the concept of text tube babies and surrogate mothers was a myth and now it is a reality. Hence research needs to be done on the nuisances of preserving the eggs in ghee pots for incubation.\nThe Story is taken from Adi Parva of Mahabharata written by sage Vedavyasa , Gita Press, Gorakhpur\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://example.org/posts/story9/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-the-story-about\"\u003eWhat is the story about?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effects of anger and jealousy are the subject matter of this story.

The prevalence of the practice of preserving eggs in ghee pots for incubation is an ingenuous scientific technique unique to Indian society; and this aspect is also covered in the current story. \u003csup id=\"fnref:1\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Story 9 - Vinata \u0026 Kadruva (the two wives of Kasyapa Prajapati)- A rivalry"},{"content":"(This is an interesting episode in Maha Bharata discussing tenets of ‘pātivratya - code of conduct for women; and the nature of democratic debates for solving common problems. The necessity of perpetuating a family lineage and the importance of following dharma in the face of adversities etc are also the themes that run through the story)\nThe Background of the Story On hearing the death of his father in the hands of Takshaka, a serpent king, Janamejaya had taken a decision to punish the whole race of serpents.\nThe Story 1 Saunaka heard everything and asked Ugrasrava, ‘Is there any other reason for the imminent death of the race of serpents?’\n‘Yes’, said Ugrasrava. ‘In fact, the serpents were cursed by their own mother and hence they were destined to die in Janamejaya’s sarpayāga’(a sacrificial ritual to kill all serpents). Uttanka was an instrument in inciting Janamejaya to conduct sarpayāga. Then he continued to narrate the story of Kadru, the mother of the serpents.\nVinata and Kadru were the two wives of Kasyapa prajāpati. Out of anger, Kadru cursed her thousand sons to get caught in Janamejaya’s sarpayāga.\nAll the serpents were in the grip of fear. The imminent sacrifice of serpents was Damocles’ sword hanging upon their heads. What was the way out? Vasuki, a senior and sober serpent called for a discussion with all his brothers and relations to mitigate the risk of being killed in the yāga. Can they all prevent Janamejaya from performing the yāga?\nAll serpents assembled at the appointed place to discuss the issue. Some serpents suggested, ‘Let us go in the guise of brahmins and seek ‘biksha’ (alms) and ask him to stop the ritual’. A few suggested, ‘Let us now join as his ministers disguising ourselves as brahmins and advise him not to perform the ritual’. A few suggested, ‘Let us bite the purohits bitterly and stop the ritual’. A few others suggested, ‘Why all this fuss? Let us bite Janamejaya and ensure that the ritual is never performed’.\nIn the assembly, there were a few kind-hearted and righteous serpents also. They disapproved of the ideas.\nसम्यक्सद्धर्म मूला वै व्यसने शांन्तिरुत्तमा | अधर्मोत्तरता नाम कृत्स्नं व्यापादयेज्जगत् || – Adi parva, 37.20.\n**(‘When danger beacons us, we need to ponder over the issue with equanimity of heart. For avoiding a difficulty, if we tread on the path of adharma, it will lead to destruction of the world’, they suggested. 2\nVasuki heard the arguments, and being a person on the path of dharma, he suggested that they all should go and seek the suggestion of their father, Kasyapa only. At this point, one little serpent by name Elaputra raised his hood and narrated a secret conversation that he heard between the Gods and Brahmaa. ‘Brahmaa was telling that the curse of Kadruva was for social good, that the serpents were venomous and that the good serpents survive the holocaust. A pious rishi, Astika will born to Jaratkaru (a rishi) and Jaratkaru, the sister of all serpents and stop the sarpa yāga’.\nThere was a big relief. The faces of all serpents at once blushed and the joy of Vasuki knew no bounds. They started searching for the savior, the rishi Jaratkaru.\n‘Jaraa’ means old age or digressed stage of life. ‘Karu’ means fearful. Since the body was reduced to fearful frailty, he was known as Jaratkaru. From childhood, he dwelt in tapas; and the pleasures of sensual nature never stared at him. He was thriving on just air and becoming physically weaker and weaker every day.\nOne day he saw human-like creatures hung from a thread of a tree branch, about to fall into a ditch. He enquired as to who they were! They replied, ‘We are forefathers of a rishi by name Jaratkaru who had forsaken marriage and doing a rigorous penance. The souls of forefathers satisfy when the progeny perpetuates down the line and when it gets stopped the souls suffer the despicable danger of destitution from the heavens. They also said,\n‘Oh, rishi! Any amount of tapas, yagna, or any other ritual is not greater than having sons. Have you seen Jaratkaru in your itinerary?’\nJaratkaru bent his head down in shame and owed on the same day to marry for the sake of progeny. He felt bad at the plight of his forefathers, and he promised them that he would marry a lady by same name, and after seeking their blessings he left the place in search of the bride.\nWho will give their daughter in marriage for a fragile old man? He wandered and wandered but in vain. At last, he reached a forest and addressing the Panch- bhutas 3 he called aloud, ‘I want to marry a lady of my name to have a son’. Somewhere yonder, a few serpents heard him and reported the news to Vasuki.\nVasuki rushed to the place with his sister, Jaratkaru. Since the rishi wanted a bride with same name, Vasuki requested him to take his sister’s hand and marry her. ‘But I cannot bear her expenses. I also cannot live with her the moment she does anything which is not liked by me’, insisted Jaratkaru.\nIt was Vasuki’s requirement and he had to prevent the holocaust of the imminent sarpayāga. He agreed to the conditions and the marriage of Jaratkarus took place immediately. ‘Don’t do anything I dislike. Don’t tell anything which is against my wish’, insisted Jaratkaru with his wife. She was pained but promised to adhere to his words. From then she served him as carefully as a dog, as fearfully as a deer and as intelligently as a crow and served like a loving wife (Adi Parva 47.11). A few months passed by, and she became pregnant.\nOne afternoon the rishi was sleeping on the lap of his wife and as he was tired, he did not wake up even by evening. The sun was about to set, and dharma dictates that one should perform ‘sandhyāvandan’. But how to wake him up? Will he feel bad and angry for disturbing his sleep? Or if not woken up, will he shout at her for transgressing dharma? Should she invite the sin of commission or attract the sin of omission? A big ethical dilemma for a dutiful wife!\nShe chose to stand by Dharma and slowly woke him up. ‘Oh Mahatma! The sun is about to set, and it is time to perform the evening ritual (sandhyāvandana) of propitiating the sun god. Jaratkaru woke up but he was very angry. ‘How dare the sun set when I was sleeping? You have insulted my power of penance. I can no longer live with you. Right now, I will leave you and go for tapas’. All the pleas of the wife fell on deaf years. ‘Swami, I have now become pregnant, but the birth of the baby is yet to happen. The fate of the clan of all serpents is dependent on the boy that is to be born out of our conjugal life. This is a critical phase and is it dharma to renounce me at this stage?’\nJaratkaru understood the anxiety of s wife. ‘A boy of resplendence shall be born and become an exemplary rishi and bring fame and name to your clan. You can go to your brother for your care-taking’, thus saying Jaratkaru left the place.\nThe lady Jaratkaru reached her brother Vasuki and narrated the turn of events. She assured her beleaguered brother that a boy would be born as per the words of her husband. In due course of time, a boy was born, and the joy of serpents knew no bounds. They named him Astika and in no time he had learnt all vedic knowledge; and he became instrumental in stopping the sarpayāga.\nStory - An analysis Indian culture, since immemorial, encouraged discussion and dissent for deciding any issue concerning the community at large. The democratic nature of religion perhaps encouraged this trend. This is precisely the reason for accepting nāstika system of thought as integral part of Hinduism 4. Coming to the story, it starts with an imminent tragedy that is going to knock the fortunes of the serpents. We see Vasuki encouraging all types of ideas from all his brothers before spelling out his own views. Allowing the people to ventilate their views is a major step in taking their confidence for any decision that is going to be taken at the end. Vasuki precisely did the same and ultimately sought spiritual solace of seeking the advice of their father, a typical Hindu traditional behavior.\nThe discussion of serpents also ended up stressing the need of adhering to dharma only. The story stresses that ‘ends and means’ are two sides of the same coin. For attaining a noble objective (preventing the sarpayāga), only noble means are to be employed. Biting the purohits or biting Janamejaya to death are not considered noble means by the sober thinking Vasuki.\nThe second aspect of the story is that of Jaratkaru’s intention of marrying a person. Is it for pleasure? No, it is for progeny. The perpetuation of family lineage is the central theme of ancient Indian thought. The belief that our forefathers will be liberated on the continuous perpetuation of family linkage is repeatedly told on many occasions in Maha Bharata. The scriptures encourage the systems of niyoga, devaranyaya etc to obviate the disintegration of the family line. It was believed in ancient times that marriage was a means to have children and for performing yagnas. Marriage was not meant for sensual pleasures and ‘kama’ has to fit in the grid; and go in tune with other three objectives of human life, viz, ‘dharma’, ‘artha’ and ‘moksha’\nThe story indirectly indicates the presence of the system of ‘Pativrata’ concept in India. Pati means husband and vrata means observance. A married woman who is in the path of protecting the husband, adhering his words and deeds and of course loyal and virtuous is supposed to be a pativrata. A dutiful chaste married lady is pativrata. Manu dharma sastra prescribes ‘stri dharma’ (code of conduct for women) in great elaboration. Even in the current story we witness the lady Jaratkaru ‘serving her husband as careful as a dog, as fearful as a deer and as intelligent as a crow and served like a loving wife’. There is always a debate that our ancient literature degrades women and did not allow them the liberties that men enjoyed. This aspect must be read in the overall context of the times in which the books were written. The story of Maha Bharata dates back to around 5100 BC and there may be three chief reasons for restricting the liberties of women in those days.\nThe days were witnessing Varna Sankara (intermingling of varnas and the associated problem of unwanted children). In Gita we witness Arjuna apprehending Varna Sankara in case of death of male community in the war. In those days people were anxious to prevent it. The relevant sloka goes like this:\nअधर्माभिभवात्कृष्ण प्रदुष्यन्ति कुलस्त्रिय:\nस्त्रीषु दुष्टासु वार्ष्णेय जायते वर्णसङ्कर: Gita 1.41\n(adharmābhibhavāt kṛiṣhṇa praduṣhyanti kula-striyaḥ\nstrīṣhu duṣhṭāsu vārṣhṇeya jāyate varṇa-saṅkaraḥ- With the preponderance of vice, the women of the family become immoral; and from the immorality of women, unwanted progeny are born.)\nThere was a tendency to insist on the necessity of preserving the chastity and purity of the race. So, the literature relating to law codes prescribed certain restrictions for women in general.\nThe third reason being the morals of those days were not encouraging openness for women - for that matter by any religion.Even Christianity downplayed the role of women. We can see it from the following passage from quoted in New York Times:\n“The New Testament quotes St. Paul (I Timothy 2) as saying that women “must be silent.” Deuteronomy declares that if a woman does not bleed on her wedding night, “the men of her town shall stone her to death.” An Orthodox Jewish prayer thanks God, “who hast not made me a woman.” The Koran stipulates that a woman shall inherit less than a man, and that a woman’s testimony counts for half a man’s” (Nicholas Kristof, 2019) 5.\nThe author is not interested in elaborating religious restrictions at length since the objective is not to point out the fault lines of any religion; but to impress the realities of those times and morals prevailing in ancient societies.\nIn the current story, though Jaratkaru served her husband, she did it out of necessity (preserving the clan of Nagas). In fact, when her husband puts a condition for his continuous stay, she felt miserable but agreed to the demands of her husband.\nWas pātivratya a compulsion? In Hindu way of life, the code of conduct is prescribed, but we can see that not all women practiced it in toto. In fact, we cannot talk of female sexuality in uniform, homogeneous, or classifiable codes- (Helene Cixous et al,(1973)) 6. We see Devayani quarrelling with her husband for his infidelity and Shakuntala openly criticizing her husband. Pātivratya, though prescribed for all, was practiced by a few in the sense in which it was drafted.\nOne greatness we witness in Hinduism is that it bestowed enormous spiritual powers to the lady who strictly followed the code of conduct. Anasuya could turn the trinity of gods into small kids and Savitri defied the lord of death and brought back the life of her husband. Kannagi could burn the city of Madurai. Bestowing of special powers to a dutiful and faithful wife is not found in other religions. Hinduism also put women of this nature (ladies adhering code of conduct) on high esteem and the concept of Ardha Nareeswara illustrates it as best example.\nThus, the common argument that men suppressed women may not be true. In Apastambha Sutra, the author, in his concluding remarks says, ‘I have not dealt with all duties. There are so many dharmas still to be learned. Know them from women and from the fourth varna’ (Voice of the Guru Pujyasri Chandrasekhara Saraswathi, “Hindu Dharma”, 2018, a book by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, page 496) which signifies importance given to women as knowledgeable persons.\nSummary The story thus encapsulates the concepts of democratic practices of discussion and dissent, the need of adhering to noble means for attaining noble ends, the concept pativratya, and lastly makes us understand the morals prevailing in ancient societies across the spectrums of major religions.\nPoints to ponder Discuss the democratic discourse prevailing in ancient Indian society. Has religion influenced democratic debate or the other way round? When there is a clash between two aspects of dharma, what do you suggest for resolving the ethical dilemma? Do you feel that morals change over a period of time? If so, can we question morals of our forefathers? How do you react if your future generations criticize your moral credentials? What is ‘pativratya’? How was it justified a few thousand years back? Can we now justify in the current century? Discuss the practices of different religions with reference to code of conduct for women in ancient societies.

Anger leads to delusion and destroys discriminating intellect. The story of Parīkṣit epitomizes the importance of anger management in day today life.\nBackground of the story Uttanka suffered a lot in the hands of the serpent, Takshaka. He wanted to take revenge against the whole race of serpents. He reached Janamejaya, the king of Hastinapura and said that the latter’s father was killed by Takshaka. He asked him to take revenge against the serpents.)\nThe Story Janamejaya was a child when he ascended the throne of Hastinapura and he was not aware of the details of his father’s death. For the first time he heard from Uttanka that his father was bitterly bitten by a serpent, Takshaka. He asked Uttanka to narrate the story of his father, Parīkṣit. Uttanka started narrating the story.\nWe all know the story of Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna who fought ferociously and finally fell in the Maha Bharata war. Abhimanyu’s son was Parīkṣit who ruled the country upholding dharma in the twilight zone of Treta Yuga and the dawn of Kali Yuga.\nस्थिताः सुमनसो राजन् तेन राज्ञा स्वधिष्ठिताः विधवानाथ विकलान् कृपणांश्च बभार सः – Adi Parva 49.11\n(He was so popular that he introduced number of welfare activities for the sake of widows, orphans, and handicapped and depressed sections of people and was bearing all their expenses 2).\nHe was also fond of hunting and one day he was chasing an animal which took him into the thick forest and disappeared.\nAfter some time, he became thirsty and reached a place where he saw a sage Samīka, a muni who was sitting in deep meditation. Parīkṣit introduced himself as the king of Hastinapur and asked whether he had seen the animal anywhere. The muni was in the path of ‘maunavratam’ (adherence to silence) at that time, and further he was in meditation mode. Hence, he did not reply. Parīkṣit was already tired and hungry. When he did not get a reply, he got very angry at the attitude of the sage that he picked up a dead serpent with his bow and put it on the neck of the sage. The sage was totally in equanimity of mind. Despite being humiliated by the king; he did not allow himself to be swayed by anger. He just ignored and never reacted. Later the king repented and left the place for his kingdom.\nSrungi was the son of Samīka. He was as powerful as his father in tapas, but he could easily be provoked by small incidents as he was infested with anger. When the incident took place, Srungi was not at the place. He got the news through his friend Krusa. ‘What is the use of your tapas when your father is insulted by a king?’ Krusa instigated. Srungi heard what had happened and got very angry and cursed Parīkṣit that he would die in seven days by the bite of Takshaka, a deadly serpent. Then he reached his father hurriedly and saw the dead serpent hanging over his father’s neck. He wept bitterly and said, ‘Dear father, see how arrogant the king is! He has insulted you and he deserved my curse. I cursed him that he would die by the bite of Takshaka in seven days.\n‘What a wrong thing you have done, my dear son? The king has been upholding dharma in this universe; and by his death, there will be none to safeguard dharma. All of us are under his protection and with his death we all will perish’, Samīka told. He further added,\nराज्ञा प्रतिष्ठितो धर्मः धर्मात् स्वर्गः प्रतिष्ठितः| राज्ञो यज्ञ क्रियास्सर्वा यज्ञाद् देवाः प्रतिष्ठिताः|| देवाद्वृष्टिः प्रवर्तेत वृष्टेरोषधयः स्मृताः| ओषधिभ्यो मनुष्याणां धारयन् सततं हितम्|| -Adi Parva 41- 29,30\n(‘The king establishes righteousness in the world. We can perform yagnas and thereby do social good under his protection only. The gods are pleased when we perform yagnas and they, in turn bless the world with rains; and through rains, the flora \u0026amp; fauna flourish 3). What you have done is out of your utter ignorance and foolishness and I admonish you’.\nSrungi realized his mistake. Basically, he was a prodigy but had fallen prey to fury and had cursed Parīkṣit. The sober words of his father had smoothened his wrath. But he never uttered an untruth in his life and his words can never go to waste. Parīkṣit was destined to die, and his curse would remain truth. Samīka wanted to correct his son and advised him to go to forest and have satvic food and control his senses.\nशम एव यतीनां हि क्षमिणां सिद्धि कारकः क्षमावता मयं लोकः परश्चैव क्षमावताम् – Adi Parva 42. 9\n(‘This world and the higher worlds belong to those who adhere to the principle of forgiveness 4).\nThen Samīka sent a word to Parīkṣit through a disciple and advised him to think of saving his life from the deadly curse. Parīkṣit received the messenger with all humility and heard his message. He was more worried about the humiliation meted out to muni than his own imminent death. He repented his mistake and sought forgiveness from Samīka.\nThe king called for a meeting of his ministers and upon their advice shifted his accommodation to a palace supported by a single pillar to obviate the entry of any serpent inside. But the curse of Srungi was designed by destiny. The palace supported by a single pillar was no longer a barrier for Takshaka. Takshaka ordered his fellow serpents to enter the palace in disguise as Brahmins. They entered as servants to the king carrying different varieties of fruits. Takshaka entered the palace as a small insect 5 through a mango; and on the seventh day he emerged out in his original form, encircled the neck, and killed the king with his deadly bite. When Parīkṣit collapsed and scorched to ashes, there was a state of petrified agony, and the ministers enthroned his minor child as the king of Hastinapura.\nUttanka concluded the story of Parīkṣit and said, ‘Oh king! Your father was innocent and never harmed the serpents. Still, Takshaka had bitten him to death. It is now the time for you to take a revenge against Parīkṣit and also the entire race of serpents.’ Janamejaya was very furious and he had taken a decision to punish the whole race of serpents.\nStory - An analysis It is said that while MahaBharata analyzes krodha (anger) in all aspects, the Ramayana analyzes kama (lust). In Mahabharata, the main character, Duryodhana was described as the personification of anger. In the story of Parīkṣit, we can see how a moment of anger can destroy lives and destinies of the countries. Parīkṣit, an upholder of dharma lost temper in a fit of rage and humiliated a muni, Samīka. The word ‘Samīka’ is derived from ‘śama’. It is antar-indriya- nigraha (control of senses, particularly mind). A person with ‘śama’ cannot be instigated with any amount of rage. The muni observed Parīkṣit putting a serpent in his neck, but he just ignored. Psychologically an angry person becomes weak if he is not confronted with an equally angry person. So Parikshit mellowed and repented profusely. Samīka knows how the quality of forgiveness is supreme in the world. Srungi, the son of Samīka is an aggressive character and he is swayed by anger. He cursed the king foolishly knowing fully well that the entire world sustains only under the benevolent leadership of the king. He never anticipated in his fury the outcome of the death of a great king. He lost his control over senses and got deluded in his thoughts; with result he lost capacity of discriminating intellect. Gita says,\nक्रोधाद्भवति संमोहः संमोहात्स्मृतिविभ्रमः। स्मृतिभ्रंशाद् बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति। Gita 2.63.\n(From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, discriminating intellect is lost. When intelligence is lost, one falls again (to the world of maya). The momentary anger of Parīkṣit resulted in insulting a muni and a momentary anger of Srungi caused the destruction of the king and the kingdom. In Srimad Bhagavata, we come across the same story of Parīkṣit as to how Kalki made inroads into the earth after the death of Parīkṣit.\nThe grand narrative of the story is to inform the audience of the destructive effect of anger. The story also highlights as to how ‘śama’ (control of inner senses) gives rise to pragmatic quality of forgiveness which ultimately sustains the world. No one can conquer the man of calm mind. The story also gives a hint as to how we can develop this quality. Samīka asks his son to do three things- have satvic food, control anger and adhere to the path of dharma.\nAyurveda, therefore, beautifully links āhāra (food), vihāra (lifestyle) and vicāra (thought process) for the development of a harmonious individual. Every art, every science, and every field of knowledge in India try to synchronize the subtle qualities of an individual for social good.\nSociological perspectives The story talks of a palace constructed upon the support of a single pillar. Do Indians know the architectural skills of building a palace on a single pillar? This aspect must be further probed. References of single pillar supported structures are found during 15th century AD when we find a story of poet Srinatha mentioning about a single pillar structure constructed by the king, Vema Reddy.\nDescribing Samīka, it is stated that he was living on the froth flown in the air when the calves were sucking the udders of mother cows. Sages appear to have been lived on austerity without any disgrace in the society in those days. Society might not have been such materialistic to loath the poor and austere community of people. In fact, they were recognized, and their intellect respected. The simplicity of their lives must have been an inspiration for others to emulate.\nTakshaka, a mighty serpent became a small insect. This aspect of reducing smaller than smallest is a spiritual power mentioned in many texts of Yoga and in Amara Kosa 6. Five thousand years ago, the people of Mahabbharata age knew this spiritual art. We have these references in Ramayana also.\nPoints to ponder What are the destructive aspects of anger? What is the importance of anger management in life? How can we control anger? What are the things suggested in this story? Do you feel that anger sprouts and shoots up by instigation? What kind of people can never be instigated? How to weaken an any angry opponent- by offence or by avoidance? This story is taken from Adi Parva of Maha Bharata written by sage Vyasa. The story also appears in Srimad Bhagavatam in more elaborative fashion. But here only the version from Adi Parva of Maha Bharata alone is taken for analysis.

Anger management is the hallmark of satva personality. This story also talks of the importance of devotion that is given in certain nitya/ naimittika karmas by our scriptures.\nBackground of the story (Saunaka, after hearing the story of Ruru \u0026amp; Pramadvara, asked Ugrasavasa, ‘Why did Janamejaya perform the Sarpayāga? Ugrasravasa started narrating the story to Saunaka and his disciples)\nUttanka’s guru, Veda relieved him from the Gurukal as he had completed his education at the Gurukul. Uttanka was pleased to present a gift to his guru before leaving for his place. He was insisting his guru to accept a gift though the guru was reluctant to accept anything from the disciple. As the sishya was insisting, he asked Uttanka to approach the guru patni (wife of Veda) and present her whatever gift she seeks for.\nUttanka approached the guru patni and requested her to ask something as a token of gift and relieve him from the debt of learning in the gurukul. At that time, she was contemplating a vratam (a ritual) involving the distribution of food to the learned and needy scholars. On that day she wanted to wear the ear-studs of the queen. She asked Uttanka to go to the court of the king Paushya and bring the ear-studs of the queen in just four days.\nUttanka hurried to meet Paushya. On the way he had no time to perform the Gayatri prayer (a regular nitya karma- a daily ritual ordained by sastras) and so he did it while walking and reached the court of king Paushya. Paushya, on hearing his request, asked him to approach the queen in the antaḥpuraṃ. Paushya entered the antaḥpuraṃ, but he did not find her. ‘Telling lies with me does not auger well with you. Your queen is not in the antaḥpuraṃ’, he told the king.\nPaushya thought for a while and said, ‘You must have gone there with saliva in the mouth or approached with unchaste demeanor and, as the queen is a pativrata (a devoted dharmic wife), she is not seen by you’, Paushya told. Uttanka recollected his diabolic approach of performing the Gayatri ritual while walking. Immediately he repented his mistake, sat there, and performed the ritual. Then he again went and found the queen. She welcomed him inside with all humility, prayed to him and asked the reason for his visit.\nUttanka narrated his story and requested the queen to part with her ear-studs so that he could present them to guru patni. The queen was pleased with his devotion to his guru and his selfless imploration. She gave her studs and bid him farewell from the place. While giving the ear-studs, she cautioned, ‘Please be careful while carrying them as the serpent king Takshaka also in need of them and he may steal them.’\nBefore leaving the court, he wanted to thank the king Paushya. On that day Uttanka was the guest and the king wanted to offer him food by performing ‘śrāddha karma’ (a naimittika karma- a ritual done with devotion to propitiate the forefathers). But Uttanka was in a hurry to meet the guru patni. He asked the king to serve the clean and sanguine food that was readily available in the house. The King obliged his request and the food that was readily available in the kitchen was served to him.\nUttanka saw a piece of hair in the rice which had already become very cold. He got angry for the king had not served the rice with sraddha (devotion). Immediately he cursed the king, ‘since you have served dirty cold rice, you shall become blind’. Paushya was taken aback and cursed him back, ‘since you are admonishing the clean food as unclean, you shall not have a progeny’.\nUttanka did not see the logic in the argument of the king. He asked the king to test the rice. The king enquired thoroughly and learnt that the rice was already cold and was prepared by a lady with untwined hair. The king pleaded guilty and begged his pardon. He asked Uttanka to reverse the curse given to him as he (king) did not want to live the life of a blind person.\n‘Oh king! My words remain truth since I never tell untruth. You shall become blind, but you will get back your eyesight very fast’. In this way I can reduce the curse. ‘Now I request you to reverse the curse that you have given to me’. Uttanka said.\nPaushya replied, ‘I am unable to reverse or modify the curse given to you since my anger against you has not come down’.\nनवनीतं हृदयं ब्राह्मणस्य, वाचि क्षुरो निशितः तीक्ष्णधारः|.\nतद् उभयम् एतत् विपरीतं क्षत्रियस्य, वाङ् नवनीतं हृदयं तीक्ष्णधारम् । – Adi Parva 3.123\n**‘It is a known fact that a Bramhin’s talk is razor like knife, but the heart is like butter that mellows. In respect of a Kshatriya both are opposite - the heart is harsh, and the talk is sweet’ 1\nPaushya continued, ‘Since I am a Kshtriya, I possess a heart that is harsh, and I cannot reduce the rigor of the curse given by me. You may please leave the place’.\nUttanka was a dharmic person and he analyzed the issue on hand with equanimity. He did not want himself to be exonerated if he was wrong. But he did not want to undergo the punishment unreasonably. He said, ‘While cursing me to become childless, you had told the reason for it as my admonishing the clean food as unclean food. You yourself tested the rice and found it unclean later. Since the food is unclean, let your curse cannot stick to me’, saying thus Uttanka left the court of Paushya.\nIt was evening sandhyāvaṃdana time. Uttanka kept the ear-studs on the floor and performing sandhyāvaṃdana. Takshaka got an opportunity to snatch away the ear-studs. He took the ear-studs and entered a hole. Uttanka prayed for Indra, and with his help, sizzled through the hole and reached Nagloka (world of the serpants). He had a very tough time to take back ear-studs from Takshaka. With the blessings of Indra, he got back the ear-studs from Takshaka and reached the place of Guru-patni. The Guru, Veda was pleased by the deeds of Uttanka and said, ‘You have done exemplary service to us. I relieve you from this Gurukul. You can go back to your parents’.\nUttanka left the place, but he was nursing bitter vengeance against Takshaka. He wanted to destroy the entire community of serpents. But how? He met Janamejaya, the king of Hastinapur and said, ‘Hi! Maharaj! You are not aware of a fact which I wish to narrate to you. Your father, Parikhit was bitterly bitten by Takshaka. It is time for you to take revenge against the serpent world. I advise you to perform Sarpayāga and destroy the whole race of serpents. Janamejaya decided to perform Sarpayāga.\nPoints to Ponder In Sanatana dharma, Shraddha’ (श्राद्धा) was given lot of importance specially in respect performing ceremonial rituals. Performing sandhyāvaṃdana by standing was considered unchaste. Sandhyāvaṃdana was supposed to be done thrice in a day with utmost Shraddha’ (श्राद्धा). The tradition is still being followed in Bharat, that is India. In Gita Krishna says that the four-fold division of society was on the basis of gunas (qualities) and the karmas (nature of works) of the people. A Brahmin was predominantly sātvik while the Kshatriya was rājaśik. This is the reason why king Paushya could not reverse his curse given to Uttanka. navanītaṃ hṛdayaṃ brāhmaṇasya,\nvāci kṣuro niśitaḥ tīkṣṇadhāraḥ|.\ntad ubhayam etat viparītaṃ kṣatriyasya,\nvāṅ navanītaṃ hṛdayaṃ tīkṣṇadhāram । – Adi Parva 3.123\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://example.org/posts/story6/","summary":"\u003ch4 id=\"about-the-story\"\u003eAbout the Story\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a famous story from Mahabharatha (Adi Parva), the verses of which are quoted very often by scholastic community to distinguish a satvic and rajasic personalities.

In that we have read the story of Maharshi Chyavana’s birth. Chyavana’s son was Pramathi who was married to an apsarasa by name Ghṛtāci. They had a son by name Ruru.\nOne day Ruru was wandering in a forest and reached an āśrama of Sthulakesa maharshi. There he saw a beautiful lady, Pramadvara. Spontaneously he fell in love with her, but he hesitated to approach the lady. He came back home, but the thoughts of Pramadvara continue to haunt him. He could not get sleep and slowly he began to forget routine activities. The parents were observing his strange behaviour and asked him as to what happened. Ruru poured out his agony before his parents and friends. Pramathi set out to see Sthulakesa’s āśrama and seek his permission for the marriage of Ruru with Pramadvara.\nSthulakesa said, ‘Hi, Pramathi! This girl Pramadvara is not my daughter. Visvavasu, a Gandharva has begotten this girl when he met Menaka. After giving birth to the child, Menaka left the girl in the vicinity of my āśrama. I found the child on the banks of a river and brought the girl to my āśrama and fostered her with all paternal affection. As a child itself, she was more beautiful than any other child, and hence I christened her as Pramadvara. I am happy that your son has fallen in love with her. I promise to give my daughter for marriage with Ruru. Everybody felt happy and the day of marriage was fixed by the elders on the spot.\nRuru and Pramadvara were reckoning for the day to usher very eagerly. One day Pramadvara went into the forest to fetch flowers, but all her thoughts were on Ruru. Accidentally she put her leg over a sleeping serpent, and alas, it had bitten her bitterly. It was so deadly that Pramadvara collapsed and died.\nThe news of the death of Pramadvara reached the āśrama of Pramathi. He rushed to the place of Sthulakasa Maharshi. All people were weeping, and it looked as though the entire forest was weeping. Unable to control the agony, Ruru left the place and went to a secluded place, and he was crying bitterly. He was seen crying, ‘If I am a tapasvi and if I had respected elders all the while, and I had done lot of charities, let the Gods infuse life into the body of my lover, Pramadvathi’.\nA messenger of Gods descended there, and he started consoling Ruru. When Ruru could not be consoled, the messenger spelt out an idea. He said, ‘I can revive the life of Pramadvara if you can forgo half of your longevity and donate it to her’. Ruru was very happy and without any hesitation he said, ‘I hereby pledge half of my longevity, and let my lover gain back her life’. The sacrifice was the testimony of his love towards his beloved. Pramadvara woke up as if she was waking up from her sleep.\nOn the appointed day, their marriage was consummated, and they spent their marriage life very happily. The love towards Pramadvara made Ruru to develop grudge against snakes. He started roaming in the forests with a big stick for killing all the snakes that come across to his sight.\nRuru \u0026amp; Dundubham One day Ruru saw an old snake in the forest. Immediately he lifted his big stick to kill it. The snake started talking, ‘Hi Rishi! I have not done any harm to you. I belong to the race of Dundubham; and Dundubham snake doesn’t possess venom and therefore, I can’t bite. There are snakes who bite and there are snakes who do not bite. Can you punish the entire race for the fault of a few?’ Ruru heard and he could not kill Dundubham. By that time, leaving the body of the snake, there emerged a rishi out of Dundubham.\nRuru was perplexed on these sudden developments. The rishi said, ‘Hi, Ruru! Listen! I am a rishi by name Sahasrapāda. Khagama was my boyfriend. One day, while we were playing together, I frightened him with a grass snake. He got irritated and out of anger he cursed me that I should become a poison- free snake. It was a child play, but it turned out to be a bitter lesson for me. He also repented for his sudden outburst of anger. He said that I could regain my natural state when I see a rishi by name Ruru. Now I presume that you are Ruru’.\nRuru was astonished and fell on the feet of Sahasrapāda. Out of love and concern, Sahasrapāda blessed Ruru and said, ‘Hi rishi! I tell you the great Truth - ‘अहिंसा परमो धर्मः ahiṃsā paramo dharmaḥ’, further you are a Brahmin. A Brahmin should always remain in satva guna. Never ever he should inflict violence on any living creature. This is ordained by Veda. The dharma of a Brahmin is Ahimsa, Satya vachanam, Kshama and Veda Dharanam 1. Please don’t follow the dharma of a Kshatriya as you are a Brahmin. A Kshatriya wields a stick, and he regulates the society and protects the people. Please do not transgress and step into the dharma of a kshatriya. Do not kill the snakes as Janamejaya did earlier in his Sarpayāga.’\nRuru heard Sahasrapāda and asked, ‘Hi Rishi! You have enlightened me and put me on the right path, and I am very grateful to you. But I want to listen from you the story of Janamejaya who indulged in the mass killing of serpents.\nSahasrapāda smiled and said, ‘You shall hear the story from someone else’. Saying thus, he disappeared.\nUgrasravasa said, ‘Oh sage, Saunaka! I have told you the story Pramadvara \u0026amp; Ruru. Their son was Sunaka and you are his son’. Saunaka was pleased to listen the story of his own lineage from the time of his ancestors, and now he was confident that Ugrasravasa was the right person to narrate the story of Mahabharata.\nPoints to ponder The story of Ruru \u0026amp; Pramadvara is the first love story in Mahabharata. Mahabharata says that love involves a sense of sacrifice (त्यागं tyāgaṃ) without any expectation from the other party. Mahabharata is an Itihāsa conceived by Veda Vyasa to make common people understand Vedic truths. The text of Mahabharata is a pretext, and Veda Vyasa chooses to illustrate Vedic dictums through stories. The first Vedic dictum pronounced by Mahabharata is अहिंसा परमो धर्मः ahiṃsā paramo dharmaḥ. Mahabharatha is not a book that encourages himsa or violence. The Kurukshetra war is a war for establishing Dharma. In many places Mahabharata brings out varṇāśrama dharma theory and encourages people not to transgress it. But at the same time, it allows people to go up in the ladder of social hierarchy by cultivating higher virtues. It also allows to push a person at the higher ladder to lower grade if he is not up to the expectations delineated for that particular varna. In Mahabharatha times, the society was divided into four varnas - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas \u0026amp; Shudras. The division was based on their guna (satva, rajas \u0026amp; tamas and their proportional mix) and karma (activity). In Gita Krishna says, चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागश: | (Gita 4.13). The duties of each varna were defined as per varṇāśrama dharma theory. A Brahmin was not supposed to rule the country or earn money by indulging in business. His duties were reading of Vedas (अध्ययनं adhyayanam), teaching of Vedas (अध्यापनं, adhyāpanaṃ), performing yagnas (यजनं ,yajanam) and getting the yagnas performed by others (याजनं yājanaṃ). He was expected to speak only Truth (satya vachanam), follow nonviolence (ahimsa), forgiving others’ mistakes (kshama) and always abide by Vedic dictums (वेद धारणं, Veda dhāraṇaṃ). The duty of a Kshatriya is to maintain law \u0026amp; order, protect the people and rule the country. The duties were earmarked for each varna.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://example.org/posts/story5/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe story is taken from Chapter 8 to 11 of Adi Parva of Mahabharatha written by sage Veda Vyasa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"background-to-the-present-story\"\u003eBackground to the present story\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgrasravasa was narrating the story of Bhrigu Vamsa to Saunaka and his ten thousand disciples.

Ugrasravasa, son of a sūta was present in the court and he had understood the entire story. He wanted to narrate the story in greater detail to greater congregations, and so, he reached the illustrious Naimisaranya where he found more than ten thousand rishis who were the disciples of Saunaka.\nUgrasravasa was very pious and humble, and he expressed his intentions to the rishis. The rishis were eager to listen to Mahabharata, but Saunaka wanted to hear the story of Bhrigu vamsa from Ugrasravasa before listening to Mahabharat. Ugrasravasa obliged to the request of Vaiśaṃpāyana, and he started narrating the story.\nBhrigu Vamsa Charitra Ugrasravasa was telling, ‘Hi Rishis! Bhargava vamsa has a glorious lineage from Brahmā. Brahmā created Maharshi Bhrigu in the great yagna performed by Varuna (the rain God). Puloma was the wife of Bhrigu, and they were a happy couple. One day sage Bhrigu went out of his āśrama leaving his pregnant wife alone. A rākṣasa by the same name Puloma was wandering around the āśrama and he happened to see the lady, Puloma.\nThe rākṣasa was so infatuated with Puloma that he started recollecting his old memories with her. The lady Puloma, when she was a little child, was always weeping in her father’s house. Her father tried to console but his efforts proved in vain. He started telling, ‘Oh Rākṣasa! Come here and take my daughter’. The girl was frightened and used to stop her cries. This was happening almost everyday in her childhood. One day Puloma, a rākṣasa heard her father calling aloud, ‘Oh Rākṣasa! Come here and take my daughter’. On hearing this, he decided that he should take away and marry the child when she attains age. ‘Now the tryst with destiny has come’ - the rākṣasa thought and he wanted to elope with her.\nThe rākṣasa entered into the āśrama and saw the Agni in the yagnakund as a flame. Before taking her with him, he wanted to ensure that she was the same girl whom he had seen a few years back and whom her father assigned to rākṣasa. He asked the God Agni, ‘Oh God! You are omnipresent and omniscient God, and nothing is unknown to you. Please tell me whether this lady is the same girl whom her father had assigned to rākṣasa. I want to know the truth. I courted this lady when she was child on the advice of her father. Now her father has given her to some other person ignoring me. Tell me who is the rightful husband for this girl?’\nThe God Agni was perplexed. It was a great dilemma for him. If he tells truth, Bhrigu may curse him. If he does not tell truth, he is liable to attract the sin of telling untruth’. Agni wanted to choose the second option. He said, ‘Oh Rākṣasa! This is same girl Puloma whom you courted in her childhood. But you have not married her as per scriptures amidst the chant of vedic mantras. But Bhrigu married her as per śāstrās in my presence. I don’t want to tell untruth. She is the same Puloma’.\nOn hearing Agni, the rākṣasa assumed the form of a varāha (a big boar) and carried her much against her will. He was yelling - ‘Your father has given you to me and I am your rightful husband’. She was crying aloud, but Bhrigu was not near to protect her. But the boy in her womb was very angry and ferociously he emerged out of her womb. His resplendence was that of the Sun in the galaxy, and he just stared at the rākṣasa. Immediately Puloma, the rākṣasa got burnt in the fire and reduced to ashes. As the boy slipped out from the womb, he was known as Chyavana.\nBhrigu cursing the God of Fire (Agni) Puloma was weeping aloud and Brahmā reached the spot. He consoled his daughter-in-law, Puloma. He saw her tears flowing as a rivulet and he named the river as Vadhūsara 1. By that time, Puloma’s husband, sage Bhrigu has also arrived. He came to know the entire thing from his wife. He got very angry with Agni and cursed him, ‘You have revealed the identity of my wife. Thou shall become sarva bhakshaka (you shall become the eater of everything - pure \u0026amp;impure; clean and unclean from henceforth’.\nAgni felt unhappy. Afterall, what was his mistake? Was telling the truth a bane? He was a witness to the events in the world and pronounced truth, and only the truth. With Bhrigu he said, ‘Hi Rishi! You have cursed me for no fault of mine. I have only told the truth. All these days I was taking the oblations put in the yagnas to the Gods. I was taking the havis to pitru devatas. I used to be there as fire in all households. How can I become sarva bhakshaka?’.\nAgni got disgusted and thought for a while and decided to withdraw his tejas from all households and yagnas. He did not want to become sarvabakshaka. There was a great problem. People came running out of the houses as could not cook anything anymore. All rishis did not know how to perform yagnas without fire. All ‘svāhā \u0026amp; svadhā’ sounds 2 dissipated into eternal silence and the very dharma that holds the social fabric appear to have been shattered.\nBrahmā summoned the God Agni and said, ‘Oh, Agni! Please do not get angry. I agree that Bhrigu has cursed you but think of the lokās (worlds) and the populace. Without you they cannot survive. In the interest of people, as a God, you are not supposed to nurture any grudge against anybody. I bless you that out of your five prāṇās, the apāna flames alone consume all the bad things. Whatever is scorched by you shall be looked upon by the world as pure things. The curse of the rishi shall be a blessing for you’. Agni obliged the order of Brahmā.\nWhile narrating the Bhrigu vamsa charitra, Ugrasravasa concluded the story of Chyavana’s birth, and Bhrigu’s curse against Agni. Points to ponder: Ugrasravasa was interested in reciting the story of Mahabharat and the rishis were also interested in listening to it. But Saunaka, the Kulapati 3asked Ugrasravasa to recite the historical anecdote of Bhrigu Vamsa. The reason is that he wanted to test the calibre of Ugrasravasa before hearing a great dharmic grandh, Mahabharat. Saunaka is from the lineage of Bhrigu vamsa and he knew his own past. If Ugrasravasa narration is unblemished, Saunaka wanted to engage him in reciting the story of Mahabharat. In childhood, when the girl, Puloma was crying, her father wanted to diffuse her agony by threatening her thar she would be carried over by rākṣasa. Even he used to call out, ‘Oh rākṣasa, come and take away my daughter’. We have a tradition in Bharat - the belief in tathāstu Gods. These are demigods who used to pronounce ‘tathāstu’ when we talk something good or bad every day. Tathāstu is tathā plus astu which means ‘let it happen like that’. Some people believe that tathāstu Gods are Asvin Gods. Tradition says that if we engage in positive thoughts and positive speech, the tathāstu Gods bless us positively. If we engage in negative thoughts and negative speech, the tathāstu Gods bless us negitively. This belief is still in vogue in all parts of India. Performance of marriage in Hindu tradition: The marriage, in order to be recognised, has to be performed as per scriptural prescription. Agni, who is the witness, tells that Bhrigu married Puloma amidst the chants of vedic mantras. But the rākṣasa just courted her in her childhood as per directions of her father and never married her as per scriptures. The tradition of Bharath since immemorial is chanting of mantras and rituals like ‘saptapadi’ are essential religious requirements. Three days back the Supreme court has ruled, “A marriage is not an event for ‘song and dance’ and ‘wining and dining’ or an occasion to demand and exchange dowry and gifts by undue pressure”. In another case it ruled, “where a Hindu marriage is not performed in accordance with the applicable rites or ceremonies such as ‘saptapadi’(taking seven steps by the groom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage will not be construed as a Hindu marriage” 4. Our traditional roots are traced in Mahabharata.This tradition has come down to us as a perennial thought in the last 5000 years. How should we take decisions when there are ethical dilemmas? In this story, Agni (the God of fire) was the witness for all events of the story. He was witness when the father of Puloma invoking rākṣasa for taking her away. The rākṣasa assumed that he was her rightful husband. He was also a witness for the marriage of Bhrigu with Puloma. The question is as to how to decide that she belongs to Bhrigu or rākṣasa.

The story under consideration revolves around Gurukul education 1 prevalent in Mahabharat times.\nOnce upon a time there lived a rishi, Ayodha Dhaumya in an āśrama surrounded by a thick forest. Upamanyu, Aruni \u0026amp; Veda were his three disciples. It was Gurukul system of learning, and all the students were learning language, grammar, mathematics, Vedic texts, Itihasas and a whole lot of yoga, pranayama, and meditation techniques under the benevolent patronage of the teacher.\nThe arduous tests - the victorious student After a passage of a few years, Ayodha Dhaumya wanted to test his students. One day he ordered Aruni to erect a bund so as to prevent the flow of water into the field. Aruni tried his best, but it was futile as the river water was gushing into the field. Aruni, however, did not go back to his teacher without completing the assigned task. He just laid down against the gush of river and forcefully stopped the water fury.\nThe Guru came in the evening and saw how Aruni was dutifully performing his task. He was pleased and asked him to come out of the field. As Aruni came out of the mud, he was given the epithet, Uddālaka (भवान् केदारखंडं विदार्योत्थितः तस्मात् उद्दालक - bhavān kedārakhaṃḍaṃ vidāryotthitaḥ tasmāt uddālaka). The Guru blessed him with all knowledge and relieved him from āśrama.\nThe test for Upamanyu The work assigned to Upamanyu was to take care of the cows of the āśram, graze them in mountainous regions and ensuring to enhance the number of cows over a period. Upamanyu was a dutiful shishya and he was taking care of them meticulously. One evening he came back with all cows and the Guru saw it.\nHe called Upamanyu and said, ‘My dear vatsa! You look very stout and very healthy. What are you eating every day?’\n‘Guruji, every day I am going out for a while for alms, and I have been eating the food offered at grihastas’ houses’, Upamanyu said. (Grihasta is a married person and who is living with family members).\nGuru said, ‘Don’t you know that you should not eat it before offering it to me?’\nFrom now onwards, Upamanyu used to give the food to Guru every day and the Guru was eating the whole food. Still Upamanyu did not lose weight even after offering the food to him. The guru called Upamanyu and said, ‘My dear vatsa! I am eating all the food that is brought by you. Even then you look very stout and very healthy. What are you eating every day?’\n‘Guruji! I am going out for alms for the second time everyday and sustaining my life’.\nGuru said, ‘Going out for alms second time on the same day is adharma. Some other needy persons may not get food for the day if any one person go for alms more than one time in a day’.\nUpamanyu stopped going for alms for the second time and still, his weight has not come down.\nGuru said, ‘My dear vatsa! I am really surprised. I am taking the entire food and I had forbidden you from going for alms second time. You look very stout and very healthy. What are you eating every day?’\n‘Hi Guruji! It is true that I am not going for alms second time. But I am taking the milk of cows everyday’.\nGuru said, ‘I have never permitted you to drink the milk. You are not allowed to drink without my permission’.\nA few days passed and still Upamanyu was stout and very healthy. On being asked, he said, ‘Guruji! I have been taking the froth that arises from the udders of the cows when they give milk to their calves’.\nThe Guru heard and said, ‘Our calves are compassionate towards you, and they are purposefully ejecting the froth while swallowing the milk from udders. I don’t permit you to take the froth’.\nUpamanyu obeyed the order of the Guru and, as usual, took out all cows to the forest region for grazing. He had not taken anything on that day. Unbearable to quench the thirst and hunger, he ate the leaves of a poisonous plant. It so happened that he lost his vision. Wandering here and there, he fell into a waterless well and he was crying aloud with pain in the stomach.\nThe Sun was set, and all the cows returned to āśram. When Upamanyu was not to be seen, the Guru enquired with other disciples. He thought that Upamanyu must be angry as he restricted all his eating activities. He took all his śiṣyās and went into forest in search of him. He was calling aloud, ‘Dear Vatsa! Upamanyu! Where are you?’\nUpamanyu heard the voice of his Guru and replied, ‘Hi Guruji! I have lost my vision and I have fallen into a well’. Guru came running and saw the plight of his śiṣyā.\nGuru said, ‘I invoked the Asvin Gods. You pray and praise them with a Stotra. They are the physicians for the Gods. They shall bless and restore your eyesight’.\nTo the surprise of everyone present there, Upamanyu started invoking the Rig Vedic verses and prayed Asvin Gods. The Asvin Gods were very much pleased and appeared before Upamanyu. They presented an appam (a sweet commonly used in Vedic times for propitiating the Gods in yagnas) and asked Upamanyu to eat it.\nUpamanyu said, ‘I cannot eat it without offering it my Guru’. The Asvins said, ‘you need not worry. In similar circumstances your Guru had eaten appam without offering it to his Guru’.\nUpamanyu said, ‘I cannot compare myself with my Guru. I am quite inferior before his towering personality. I cannot eat it without offering it to him’.\nAsvins were pleased by his steadfast devotion towards his Guru and blessed him with eyesight. The Guru blessed his disciple that all Vedas, śāstrās and Dharma śāstrās shall get bestowed upon him. He relieved Upamanyu from Gurukulam.\nThe test for the third śiṣyā, Veda The test for Veda was arduous as the Guru used to assign difficult tasks including carrying heavy luggage. With all fortitude Veda adhered to the dictums of his Guru. Ayodha Dhaumya was satisfied and felt happy. The blessings of Guru resulted in all wisdom dawning upon the śiṣyā. Later with the consent of his Guru, he underwent samāvartana saṃskāram 2 and snātaka saṃskāram 3 and finally entered into Gruhasta āśrama 4.\nVeda established his own āśrama, and he had three śiṣyās and Uttanka happened to be his favourite śiṣyā. Since he (Veda) knew the difficulties of Gurukula, he wanted to be a benevolent Guru, and he was not assigning any difficult task to his disciples.\nUnderstanding the Story The story revolves around Gurukul education system of our past. On primary reading it appears that the gurus used to behave like dictators and the students were made to perform the errand works of Guru and they were working like servants in the house of Guru. But this is far from truth, and we are not suppose to look at the system with moral lenses of the current century. ‘Spare the rod and spoil the child’ was the dictum of the Gurukul system. Discipline brings forth other virtues and naturally, they used to insist on discipline, punctuality, adherence to the words of guru and the like. The gurus use to hiss and never use to bite the disciples. They have all love and affection, and they don’t distinguish śiṣyās from their own children. From the story of Drona, we find that he had given some special अस्त्रास् (astrās ) to Arjun and never gave them to his own son, Asvatthama. Certainly, there was no pampering of students by gurus or parents; and gurus’ actions were never questioned by parents.\nIn Gurukulas, the disciples use to learn plethora of subjects including astronomy, grammar, language, philosophy, ayurveda, and also Vedas, Itihasas, Dharmasastras and the like. Vedas unlike other subjects require high sense of intonation with उदात्त, अनुदात्त, स्वरित (udātta, anudātta \u0026amp; svarita corresponding to high stress, low stress and uniform stress) and can be learnt directly under Guru. This requires high sense of discipline physically and mentally. Hence, teachers in Gurukul used to give more importance to discipline. If Ayodha Dhaumya was very strict, it is due to its importance in Gurukul system of pedagogy.\nIn this story Ayodha Dhaumya is very strict but at the same time he was bestowing all knowledge to his disciples at the right time. Upamanyu got the opportunity of getting blessed by Asvin Gods.\nThe second aspect of the story is that Vedavyasa has written a powerful Stotra for Asvin Gods which was sung by Upamanyu. The tradition says that this Stotra has a potency to have good vision and eyesight. In traditional houses this Stotra is a नित्यपारायण स्तोत्र (nityapārāyaṇa Stotra)- a Stotra that is recited every day.\nWhy did Vedavyasa introduce this story in the beginning of Mahabharata? In Mahabharata we are going to read the stories of many śiṣyās - like Arjuna under Drona; Karna under Drona \u0026amp; Parasurama; Ekalavya under Drona; Bhishma under Parasurama; Drona under Agnivesa \u0026amp; Parasurama etc. In these stories we are going to find that the cunning students getting admonitions and disciplined students getting commendations. The future events of Mahabharata story are portended in the beginning itself by Vedavyasa.\nGurukul System of education - It is type of residential schooling system in which the śiṣyās lives with the acharya or guru. The acharya feeds him, teaches him, and treats him one with the family. The śiṣyās helps the guru in his day-to-day work and learns secular and religious lessons. This is how the education was imparted to everyone during the Vedic period and Mahabharata period well up to the 18th century till the British introduced an alternative day-boarding system.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSamāvartana saṃskāram - briefly, this ritual indicates the end of विद्यार्थि जीवनं (vidyārthi jīvanaṃ) and returning back to home. It is a sort of convocation wherein the teacher dictates the dos and don’ts to his disciple in gruhasta life. For example, in Taitiriya Upanishad we have a passage of a teacher to his disciple thus:\nसत्यान्न प्रमदितव्यम् । धर्मान्न प्रमदितव्यम् । कुशलान्न प्रमदितव्यम् । भूत्यै न प्रमदितव्यम् । स्वाध्यायप्रवचनाभ्यां न प्रमदितव्यम् ।\nदेवपितृकार्याभ्यां न प्रमदितव्यम् । मातृदेवो भव । पितृदेवो भव । आचार्यदेवो भव । अतिथिदेवो भव । यान्यनवद्यानि कर्माणि । तानि सेवितव्यानि । नो इतराणि । यान्यस्माकं सुचरितानि । तानि त्वयोपास्यानि । नो इतराणि ।\nये के चास्मच्छ्रेयांसो ब्राह्मणाः । तेषां त्वयासनेन प्रश्वसितव्यम् । श्रद्धया देयम् । अश्रद्धयाऽदेयम् । श्रिया देयम् । ह्रिया देयम् । भिया देयम् । संविदा देयम् । अथ यदि ते कर्मविचिकित्सा वा वृत्तविचिकित्सा वा स्यात् । ये तत्र ब्राह्मणाः संमर्शिनः । युक्ता आयुक्ताः । अलूक्षा धर्मकामाः स्युः । यथा ते तत्र वर्तेरन् । तथा तत्र वर्तेथाः । अथाभ्याख्यातेषु । ये तत्र ब्राह्मणाः संमर्शिनः । युक्ता आयुक्ताः । अलूक्षा धर्मकामाः स्युः । यथा ते तेषु वर्तेरन् । तथा तेषु वर्तेथाः ।\nएष आदेशः । एष उपदेशः । एषा वेदोपनिषत् । एतदनुशासनम् । एवमुपासितव्यम् ।\nएवमु चैतदुपास्यम् ॥\nMeaning:\nWhen the Master has declared Veda, then he gives the commandments to his disciple.\nSpeak truth, walk in the way of thy duty, neglect not the study of Veda. When thou hast brought to the Master the wealth that he desires, thou shalt not cut short the long thread of thy race. Thou shalt not be negligent of truth; thou shalt not be negligent of thy duty, thou shalt not be negligent of welfare; thou shalt not be negligent towards thy increase and thy thriving; thou shalt not be negligent of the study and teaching of Veda.\nThou shalt not be negligent of thy works unto the Gods or thy works unto the Fathers. Let thy father be unto thee as thy God and thy mother as thy Goddess whom thou adorest. Serve the Master as a God and as a God the stranger within thy dwelling. The works that are without blame before the people, thou shalt do these with diligence and no others. The deeds we have done that are good and righteous, thou shalt practise these as a religion and no others.\nWhosoever are better and nobler than we among the scholars, thou shalt refresh with a seat to honour them. Thou shalt give with faith and reverence; without faith thou shalt not give. Thou shalt give with shame, thou shalt give with fear; thou shalt give with fellow feeling.\nMoreover, if thou doubt of thy course or of thy action, then to whatsoever great people be there who are careful thinkers, devout, not moved by others, lovers of virtue, not severe or cruel, even as they do in that thing, so do thou. Then as to men accused and arraigned by their fellows, whatsoever great men be there who are careful thinkers, devout, not moved by others, lovers of virtue, not severe or cruel, even as they are towards these so be thou.\nThis is the law and the teaching. These are the Commandments. In such wise shalt thou practise religion yea, verily, in such wise do ever religiously. (Translation taken from Kirit Joshi archives)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSnātaka saṃskāram - this ritual is done before the विवाह संस्कारं (vivāha saṃskāraṃ or marriage ceremony) wherein the brahmachari is made eligible for marriage.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nGruhasta āśrama - In this āśrama, the head of the family has to earn Artha or money through dharmic means and perform the vihita karmas or the rituals ordained by vedas; and he should provide food to brahmacharis, sanyasis and other guests.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://example.org/posts/story3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Gurukul education was a prominent system in ancient Bharat (India) and it was there till the nineteenth century when the Macaulay Minute was formulated in 1835.

The king of Hastinapura, Janamejaya (Arjuna’s son is Parikshit and his son is Janamejaya) was performing a satra yāgaṃ assisted by his three brothers- Sruthasena, Ugrasena and Bhimasena. Satra yāgaṃ was supposed to benefit the humanity at large and the king was interested in it.\nThe story of the first dog It so happened that a puppy by name Sārameyaṃ was anxiously watching the yāgaṃ without disturbing anybody at the yagñaśāla (place of the yagnam). But the brothers of Janamejaya went up to the puppy and they had beaten it with sticks. The puppy ran away from the spot weeping loudly and reached to the place of its mother, Sarama. It complained that the king’s brothers had beaten it.\nSarama said, ‘Dear son! You must have offended them by doing something wrong and they must have punished you’.\n‘No mother. I am sure that I never offended anybody. I neither touched nor licked the havis (an oblation/sacrifice/sacrificial cake) 1\nSarama consoled its son but determined to complain to the king. It went to the court of the king and sad, ‘Oh king! My son has not committed any crime. On what grounds was he beaten up?’. The king and his brothers were unable to reply.\nSarama said, ‘Oh king! You have committed a mistake and beaten up a pious person. For this act of impropriety, you shall have a definite trouble’, saying thus, Sarama left the court.\nThe king was all the time worrying as he was guilty of a crime, and he was searching for a learned Purohit to ward off the sin.\nWe find this as the first story of Mahabharata in Adiparva.\nThe story of the second dog Svargārohaṇa parva /स्वर्गारोहण पर्व or the Book of the Ascent to Heaven, is the last of eighteen books of the Indian epic Mahabharata. After the great battle of Kurukshetra Pandavas became victorious and ruled Hastinapura for thirty-six years. The news of the niryana of Sri Krishna was a thunderbolt for Pandavas. They decided to renounce the kingdom in favour of the grandson of Arjun, Parikshit and proceeded to Himalayas for ascent to heaven 2\nWhen they started their journey, a dog started following them dutifully. When they were moving fast, Draupadi was the first to fall on to the ground. Bhima got perturbed and said, ‘My dear brother! Draupadi has fallen. What wrong she had committed in life?’\nYudhishtir replied, ‘Oh Bhim! She has fallen from yoga nishta since, while living, she had a special love towards Arjuna’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and others followed him. After a couple of minutes Sahadeva fell on the ground. Again, Bhima asked as to why he had fallen.\nYudhishtir said, ‘Oh Bhim! Sahadeva used to feel that no other person matched him in wisdom. Hence, he has fallen’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and others followed him.\nThen it was Nakul who had fallen to the ground. Upon asking, Yudhishtir said, ‘Oh Bhim! Nakul has fallen from Yoganishta since he was always thinking that he was the most handsome person upon the earth’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and others followed him.\nThen the mighty warrior, Arjun too had fallen to the ground. Yudhishtir said, ‘Arjun is proud of his valour. He used to denounce and denigrate other warriors. Hence, he has fallen’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and Bhimasena followed him.\nThen Bhima fell upon the ground. While dying, he cried and asked Yudhishtir as to what was the cause for his falling. Without turning back, Yudhishtir said, ‘You are a glutton and you also used to think very high of yourself’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and the dog followed him.\nBy that time, there was a thunder upon the sky and Lord Indra was seen on a chariot. He came up to Yudhishtir and said, ‘Hi, Yudhishtir! You are steadfast in your yoganishta. You are eligible to enter the heaven. Please sit in the chariot and I will take you to heaven’.\nYudhistir said, ‘Hi Devraj! All my brothers and my beloved wife have fallen here. Without them I cannot enter the heaven’.\n‘You need not worry for them. They have left their mortal bodies and reached higher worlds. Undoubtedly you can come with your physical body’, Indra said.\nYudhistar said, ‘This dog is so devoted to me that I cannot leave it. Let it also come with me’.\n‘Oh king! You have attained immortality and now you are as equal as the gods. You can enter the heaven. Dogs cannot enter there. And no one can stay in heaven with dogs’, Indra said.\n‘Oh, King of Heaven! The dog is my steadfast follower, and it is my devotee. Leaving it in the lurch is a great sin’.\nIndra said, ‘As per scriptures the very look of a dog negates one’s punyam acquired out of charity and performance yagnas. By virtue of your merits, you have the privilege to enter heaven. You have already renounced your brothers and wife. Why don’t you leave this dog? Why do you have attachment towards the dog?’\n‘Oh Indra! For the dead, it is not good to grieve. I was helpless when they were dying, and I could not save them from death. I have not renounced them when they were alive. Now this dog is alive and it is dutifully following me. I cannot leave it and even think of heaven without it’.\nIndra felt very happy at Yudhistar’s dharma nishta and his avowed love towards all living creatures. The dog disappeared and there was Dharmadevatha (God of Dharma) before him. He blessed Dharmaraja and said, ‘You have not left your bhakta and even ready to sacrifice the heaven for his sake. I was the person who tested your sagacity as a Yaksha. Now your fame cannot be compared or matched by anybody’s fame. Please go with Indra to heaven’.\nDharmaraja alighted the chariot of Indra and reached heaven.\nUnderstanding the Story Mahabharata is an epic with eighteen books and one lakh slokas. Conceiving the idea of two dog stories – one at the beginning and one at the end has lot of symbolic significance. If we carefully observe the narration, we find that it was really dog’s life for the first dog. It suffered indignations and sufferings in the hands of a recalcitrant authorities. It did not get justice when the king exhibited stoic silence and did not punish his brothers. The dog of the second story was put on high pedestal by the king and he was prepared to sacrifice heaven for its sake. Though the dog remained silent, the king understood its sensibilities and did not leave it in the lurch; and demanded that it should be given entry into heaven.\nThe question that arises is – why did Veda Vyasa choose to put these stories? He wants to prove that a discourse on dharma embedded in Mahabharata makes a person humane. Mahabharata leads you from lawless state to an illustrious legal state; an adharmic state to dharmic state and from indignation to tranquillity.\nWhat was the status of dog in ancient times? Was it a disgraceful creature in Mahabharata times? May not be so. If so, Vedavyasa would not have started his masterpiece, Mahabharata with the story of Sarama. We have also references in Mahabharata that the kings used to take their dogs for hunting. Ekalavya story is the best example wherein we find Kauravas and Pandavas took hunting dogs to the forest. We have a reference of a story of one dog, Sarama assisting Indra in his battles against Asuras in Rig Veda. The was also associated in the pitṛkāryas, particularly within ten days after the death of the mortal body. It appears that not allowing dogs inside houses when auspicious events were taking place was a later tradition. The same tradition is being followed even today in auspicious occasions.\nThe power to stand up and question the authority occupying the echelons of the hierarchy was imbedded in Hindu society in ancient times. We see Sarama demanding justice without any fear in the royal court of Janamejaya. This tradition of questioning on rational grounds is certainly sine qua non of democratic temperament that remain existed even today. Why Yudhishtir did not grieve when all his brothers and wife were falling to the ground one after another? Yudhishtir was a raja yogi, and he was knowing very well that it was futile to grieve over the dead. Gita also emphasizes that the wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead 3. Why did Yudhishtir refuse to leave the dog for going to heaven? – because he was not willing to lose his follower for his own sake. Taking care of one’s servants / bhaktas/ followers is one of the great virtues of a leader and Yudhishtir was adept in this activity. If a dog looks at annam, it is sin; If a beak of a cuckoo is fallen in annam, it is considered sin. “kukkuṭaḥ pakṣavātena śvā dṛṣṭyānnaṃ pradūṣayet” – कुक्कुटः पक्षवातेन श्वा दृष्ट्यान्नं प्रदूषयेत् (sakuna sastram).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSwargarohini Trek is a mountain group of four peaks in Garhwal Himalayas.

Once upon a time, Saunaka Maharshi was performing Satrayāga in the vicinity of his āśramaṃ with the help of all his disciples. Satrayāga was of twelve years long duration and all the rishis were committed to perform it with all sincerity and zeal.\nUgrasrava, the son of Romaharshana was a sūta, but highly proficient in narrating tales of all purāṇās and itihāsās. He was physically present in the court of king Janamejaya when sage Vaiśaṃpāyana narrated the story of Mahabharata to the king upon the instructions of Vedavyasa. He was searching for a receptible audience that can listen to his words. Upon seeing a congregation of ten thousand students of Saunaka at Naimiśāraṇya, he was thrilled and reached them.\nThe students of Saunaka received him very well and they were eager to listen the story of Kauravas and Pandavas from Ugrasava. By that time, Saunaka arrived at the spot and greeted Ugrasrava. He enquired about his yogakshema and asked the reason for his arrival to Naimiśāraṇya.\nMahabharata – the brainchild of Veda Vyasa Ugrasrava was happy and he started telling. ‘I have come from the court of King Janamejaya who was performing the Sarpayāga (a yāga conducted to annihilate the snakes) and I heard the entire story of the kings of Kuru clan from Vaiśaṃpāyana, the direct disciple of Vedavyasa. Before answering any of your questions I wish to narrate the brief background of Mahabharata’. The rishis were happy, and they enthusiastically asked him to narrate the brief account of Mahabharata.\nUgrasrava started telling. ‘Oh Rishis, Mahabharata is the largest ever known story – both in vastness and richness (महत्वात् भारवत्वात् इति भारतं). Sitting in the lap of Himalayas, the sage Vyasa perceived all the events of Kurus from his intellect-eye (ज्ञान नेत्र) and conceived the storyline. He saw in this story the essence of Vedas, vedāngās and purāṇās. He also saw vividly the dharma, Artha, kama \u0026amp; Moksha which are essential objectives of mankind. He also visualised geographic entities such as rivers, mountains, lakes, and oceans; forests, janapadas, and the people of different regions. He perceived the philosophy, logic, psychology, music, justice, jurisprudence, laws, morals, ethics and the very origin of earth, cosmos, and the origin of galaxies. He saw the births, deaths, worries, and fears that haunt the mankind. He thought that it would be prudent to present the Mahabharat itihās to the populace who could not directly understand the vedas and Upanishads. He wanted to use the text of Mahabharata as a pretext to covey the dictums present in vedas’.\nVyasa, the author and Ganesha, the writer ‘But who would write it? Vedavyasa invited Brahmā to his place and sought his help in arranging a writer who can match his speed of articulation. Brahmā suggested to take the help of Ganesha in his endeavour.\nWhen Ganesha arrived at Himalayas, Vedavyasa sought his help in writing the book of Mahabharata. Ganesha thought for a while and said, ‘Yes, I can write while you recite the slokas. But I have a condition. You should keep telling and never allow my pen to stop even for a second’. This is a big challenge, given the speed of Ganesha in writing things. Vedavyasa thought for a while and said, ‘Yes. I can never let your pen stop even for a second. But I too have a condition – you should write only after understanding whatever I recite. You cannot write monotonously’. Ganesha agreed and both sat for about three years to complete the project.\nSaunaka was surprised and said, ‘Did Vyasa narrate the story non-stop?’\n‘No. To gain time, here and there he recited slokas which can have multiple meanings and not very easy to decipher. Ganesh has to sit back, ponder over the correct meaning and then he was writing. By that time, Vedavyasa could conceive a few dozen slokas to keep engage the attention of Ganesha. In this way Vyasa recited around eight thousand eight hundred difficult slokas which are popularly known as ‘Grandh Grandhi’ (Grandhi means a knot)’.\nThey, thus, completed compiling Mahabharata in around three years’ time.\nMahabharata – how it spread? Janamejaya was a great grandson of Arjuna (Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna. His son was Parīkṣit and Parīkṣit’s son was Janamejaya). When Janamejaya ascended the throne, he was minor boy, and he was not aware of the story of his great grandfathers. He was performing Sarpa yāgaṃ (a sacrifice to annihilate the entire race of snakes). A rishi by name Asthika influenced the king and thus the yāgaṃ came to an end. Vedavyasa came to the court of Janamejaya and upon the request of the later, deputed his disciple Vaiśaṃpāyana to narrate the entire story to the king in his court.\nUgrasrava concluded his narration and said to Saunaka, ‘Hi Rishi! I was present in the court of Janamejaya when the Mahabharata narration took place. With all supporting upākhyānās (stories not directly connected main storyline) the Mahabharata is of one lakh slokas. Now I can narrate the whole story which I had heard from Vaiśaṃpāyana.\nThe rishis were happy and sat around the sūta for hearing Mahabharata.\nPoints to Ponder The purpose of writing Mahabharata by Vedavyasa is to spread the message of Vedas to common people (वेदोपबृंहणार्थाय- vedopabṛṃhaṇārthāya). Vedas, it is said, are like commandments of a king – like ‘satyam vada’, ‘dharmam chara’ etc. The depth of the dictums may be understood by the enlightened persons. To make them understand for common people it is necessary to weave a story, for example, the story of Harischandra, Nala, or Sibi. Mahabharata and its stories are case studies to understand the nuances of dharma. Hence it is called Panchama Veda or fifth Veda (the other four being Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda \u0026amp; Adharvana Veda). Mahabharata has been narrated by Ugrasrava, a sūta by caste and it was listened by a rishi and his ten thousand students. A sūta is from the progeny of chariot makers. In Mahabharata times the intellect and the wisdom of the person decided his social status and there was no hesitation for rishis to listen to his narrative. It was an egalitarian society. The Kulapati concept was very prominent in Bharat in ancient times. It is like a present-day university where the pupils congregate to study different fields of study. The calling of the present-day vice chancellor as Kulapati is thus an apt translation of the word. Mahabharata is a vast book with eighteen Parvas. It is an elaborate narration of all fields of knowledge of its time. Vedavyasa visualised it and pronounced famously – ” यदिहास्ति तदन्यत्र यन्नेहास्ति न तत् क्वचित् “- yadihāsti tadanyatra yannehāsti na tat kvacit”. It means whatever here is there anywhere; and what is not here is nowhere. In Mahabharata we find the famous scripture Bhagavad Gita. We also find Vidura Niti, Vishnu Sahasranama, Yaksha Prasnas, and a vast number of anecdotes depicting raj niti, dharma, ethics and moral principles.

Satrayāga was of twelve years long duration and all the rishis were committed to perform it with all sincerity and zeal.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Story 1 - The Origin and Emergence of Mahabharatha"},{"content":"Introduction Greetings, history enthusiasts, and welcome to a celebration of knowledge as we mark the first anniversary of our blog!
