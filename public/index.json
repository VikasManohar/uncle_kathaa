[{"content":"(Vedavyasa Mahabharatam – the story, the ethics, morals \u0026amp; the traditions) Very interestingly, the first and the last story of Mahabharata is that of a dog. The king of Hastinapura, Janamejaya (Arjuna’s son is Parikshit and his son is Janamejaya) was performing a satra yāgaṃ assisted by his three brothers- Sruthasena, Ugrasena and Bhimasena. Satra yāgaṃ was supposed to benefit the humanity at large and the king was interested in it.\nThe story of the first dog It so happened that a puppy by name Sārameyaṃ was anxiously watching the yāgaṃ without disturbing anybody at the yagñaśāla (place of the yagnam). But the brothers of Janamejaya went up to the puppy and they had beaten it with sticks. The puppy ran away from the spot weeping loudly and reached to the place of its mother, Sarama. It complained that the king’s brothers had beaten it.\nSarama said, ‘Dear son! You must have offended them by doing something wrong and they must have punished you’.\n‘No mother. I am sure that I never offended anybody. I neither touched nor licked the havis (an oblation/sacrifice/sacrificial cake)[i].\nSarama consoled its son but determined to complain to the king. It went to the court of the king and sad, ‘Oh king! My son has not committed any crime. On what grounds was he beaten up?’. The king and his brothers were unable to reply.\nSarama said, ‘Oh king! You have committed a mistake and beaten up a pious person. For this act of impropriety, you shall have a definite trouble’, saying thus, Sarama left the court.\nThe king was all the time worrying as he was guilty of a crime, and he was searching for a learned Purohit to ward off the sin.\nWe find this as the first story of Mahabharata in Adiparva.\nThe story of the second dog Svargārohaṇa parva /स्वर्गारोहण पर्व or the Book of the Ascent to Heaven, is the last of eighteen books of the Indian epic Mahabharata. After the great battle of Kurukshetra Pandavas became victorious and ruled Hastinapura for thirty-six years. The news of the niryana of Sri Krishna was a thunderbolt for Pandavas. They decided to renounce the kingdom in favour of the grandson of Arjun, Parikshit and proceeded to Himalayas for ascent to heaven[ii].\nWhen they started their journey, a dog started following them dutifully. When they were moving fast, Draupadi was the first to fall on to the ground. Bhima got perturbed and said, ‘My dear brother! Draupadi has fallen. What wrong she had committed in life?’\nYudhishtir replied, ‘Oh Bhim! She has fallen from yoga nishta since, while living, she had a special love towards Arjuna’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and others followed him. After a couple of minutes Sahadeva fell on the ground. Again, Bhima asked as to why he had fallen.\nYudhishtir said, ‘Oh Bhim! Sahadeva used to feel that no other person matched him in wisdom. Hence, he has fallen’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and others followed him.\nThen it was Nakul who had fallen to the ground. Upon asking, Yudhishtir said, ‘Oh Bhim! Nakul has fallen from Yoganishta since he was always thinking that he was the most handsome person upon the earth’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and others followed him.\nThen the mighty warrior, Arjun too had fallen to the ground. Yudhishtir said, ‘Arjun is proud of his valour. He used to denounce and denigrate other warriors. Hence, he has fallen’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and Bhimasena followed him.\nThen Bhima fell upon the ground. While dying, he cried and asked Yudhishtir as to what was the cause for his falling. Without turning back, Yudhishtir said, ‘You are a glutton and you also used to think very high of yourself’. Without turning back, Yudhishtir moved on, and the dog followed him.\nBy that time, there was a thunder upon the sky and Lord Indra was seen on a chariot. He came up to Yudhishtir and said, ‘Hi, Yudhishtir! You are steadfast in your yoganishta. You are eligible to enter the heaven. Please sit in the chariot and I will take you to heaven’.\nYudhistir said, ‘Hi Devraj! All my brothers and my beloved wife have fallen here. Without them I cannot enter the heaven’.\n‘You need not worry for them. They have left their mortal bodies and reached higher worlds. Undoubtedly you can come with your physical body’, Indra said.\nYudhistar said, ‘This dog is so devoted to me that I cannot leave it. Let it also come with me’.\n‘Oh king! You have attained immortality and now you are as equal as the gods. You can enter the heaven. Dogs cannot enter there. And no one can stay in heaven with dogs’, Indra said.\n‘Oh, King of Heaven! The dog is my steadfast follower, and it is my devotee. Leaving it in the lurch is a great sin’.\nIndra said, ‘As per scriptures the very look of a dog negates one’s punyam acquired out of charity and performance yagnas. By virtue of your merits, you have the privilege to enter heaven. You have already renounced your brothers and wife. Why don’t you leave this dog? Why do you have attachment towards the dog?’\n‘Oh Indra! For the dead, it is not good to grieve. I was helpless when they were dying, and I could not save them from death. I have not renounced them when they were alive. Now this dog is alive and it is dutifully following me. I cannot leave it and even think of heaven without it’.\nIndra felt very happy at Yudhistar’s dharma nishta and his avowed love towards all living creatures. The dog disappeared and there was Dharmadevatha (God of Dharma) before him. He blessed Dharmaraja and said, ‘You have not left your bhakta and even ready to sacrifice the heaven for his sake. I was the person who tested your sagacity as a Yaksha. Now your fame cannot be compared or matched by anybody’s fame. Please go with Indra to heaven’.\nDharmaraja alighted the chariot of Indra and reached heaven.\nUnderstanding the Story Mahabharata is an epic with eighteen books and one lakh slokas. Conceiving the idea of two dog stories – one at the beginning and one at the end has lot of symbolic significance. If we carefully observe the narration, we find that it was really dog’s life for the first dog. It suffered indignations and sufferings in the hands of a recalcitrant authorities. It did not get justice when the king exhibited stoic silence and did not punish his brothers. The dog of the second story was put on high pedestal by the king and he was prepared to sacrifice heaven for its sake. Though the dog remained silent, the king understood its sensibilities and did not leave it in the lurch; and demanded that it should be given entry into heaven.\nThe question that arises is – why did Veda Vyasa choose to put these stories? He wants to prove that a discourse on dharma embedded in Mahabharata makes a person humane. Mahabharata leads you from lawless state to an illustrious legal state; an adharmic state to dharmic state and from indignation to tranquillity.\nWhat was the status of dog in ancient times? Was it a disgraceful creature in Mahabharata times? May not be so. If so, Vedavyasa would not have started his masterpiece, Mahabharata with the story of Sarama. We have also references in Mahabharata that the kings used to take their dogs for hunting. Ekalavya story is the best example wherein we find Kauravas and Pandavas took hunting dogs to the forest. We have a reference of a story of one dog, Sarama assisting Indra in his battles against Asuras in Rig Veda. The was also associated in the pitṛkāryas, particularly within ten days after the death of the mortal body. It appears that not allowing dogs inside houses when auspicious events were taking place was a later tradition. The same tradition is being followed even today in auspicious occasions.\nThe power to stand up and question the authority occupying the echelons of the hierarchy was imbedded in Hindu society in ancient times. We see Sarama demanding justice without any fear in the royal court of Janamejaya. This tradition of questioning on rational grounds is certainly sine qua non of democratic temperament that remain existed even today. Why Yudhishtir did not grieve when all his brothers and wife were falling to the ground one after another? Yudhishtir was a raja yogi, and he was knowing very well that it was futile to grieve over the dead. Gita also emphasizes that the wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead[iii]. Why did Yudhishtir refuse to leave the dog for going to heaven? – because he was not willing to lose his follower for his own sake. Taking care of one’s servants / bhaktas/ followers is one of the great virtues of a leader and Yudhishtir was adept in this activity.\nFoot notes: [i] If a dog looks at annam, it is sin; If a beak of a cuckoo is fallen in annam, it is considered sin. “kukkuṭaḥ pakṣavātena śvā dṛṣṭyānnaṃ pradūṣayet” – कुक्कुटः पक्षवातेन श्वा दृष्ट्यान्नं प्रदूषयेत् (sakuna sastram).\n[ii] Swargarohini Trek is a mountain group of four peaks in Garhwal Himalayas.

Once upon a time, Saunaka Maharshi was performing Satrayāga in the vicinity of his āśramaṃ with the help of all his disciples. Satrayāga was of twelve years long duration and all the rishis were committed to perform it with all sincerity and zeal.\nUgrasrava, the son of Romaharshana was a sūta, but highly proficient in narrating tales of all purāṇās and itihāsās. He was physically present in the court of king Janamejaya when sage Vaiśaṃpāyana narrated the story of Mahabharata to the king upon the instructions of Vedavyasa. He was searching for a receptible audience that can listen to his words. Upon seeing a congregation of ten thousand students of Saunaka at Naimiśāraṇya, he was thrilled and reached them.\nThe students of Saunaka received him very well and they were eager to listen the story of Kauravas and Pandavas from Ugrasava. By that time, Saunaka arrived at the spot and greeted Ugrasrava. He enquired about his yogakshema and asked the reason for his arrival to Naimiśāraṇya.\nMahabharata – the brainchild of Veda Vyasa Ugrasrava was happy and he started telling. ‘I have come from the court of King Janamejaya who was performing the Sarpayāga (a yāga conducted to annihilate the snakes) and I heard the entire story of the kings of Kuru clan from Vaiśaṃpāyana, the direct disciple of Vedavyasa. Before answering any of your questions I wish to narrate the brief background of Mahabharata’. The rishis were happy, and they enthusiastically asked him to narrate the brief account of Mahabharata.\nUgrasrava started telling. ‘Oh Rishis, Mahabharata is the largest ever known story – both in vastness and richness (महत्वात् भारवत्वात् इति भारतं). Sitting in the lap of Himalayas, the sage Vyasa perceived all the events of Kurus from his intellect-eye (ज्ञान नेत्र) and conceived the storyline. He saw in this story the essence of Vedas, vedāngās and purāṇās. He also saw vividly the dharma, Artha, kama \u0026amp; Moksha which are essential objectives of mankind. He also visualised geographic entities such as rivers, mountains, lakes, and oceans; forests, janapadas, and the people of different regions. He perceived the philosophy, logic, psychology, music, justice, jurisprudence, laws, morals, ethics and the very origin of earth, cosmos, and the origin of galaxies. He saw the births, deaths, worries, and fears that haunt the mankind. He thought that it would be prudent to present the Mahabharat itihās to the populace who could not directly understand the vedas and Upanishads. He wanted to use the text of Mahabharata as a pretext to covey the dictums present in vedas’.\nVyasa, the author and Ganesha, the writer ‘But who would write it? Vedavyasa invited Brahmā to his place and sought his help in arranging a writer who can match his speed of articulation. Brahmā suggested to take the help of Ganesha in his endeavour.\nWhen Ganesha arrived at Himalayas, Vedavyasa sought his help in writing the book of Mahabharata. Ganesha thought for a while and said, ‘Yes, I can write while you recite the slokas. But I have a condition. You should keep telling and never allow my pen to stop even for a second’. This is a big challenge, given the speed of Ganesha in writing things. Vedavyasa thought for a while and said, ‘Yes. I can never let your pen stop even for a second. But I too have a condition – you should write only after understanding whatever I recite. You cannot write monotonously’. Ganesha agreed and both sat for about three years to complete the project.\nSaunaka was surprised and said, ‘Did Vyasa narrate the story non-stop?’\n‘No. To gain time, here and there he recited slokas which can have multiple meanings and not very easy to decipher. Ganesh has to sit back, ponder over the correct meaning and then he was writing. By that time, Vedavyasa could conceive a few dozen slokas to keep engage the attention of Ganesha. In this way Vyasa recited around eight thousand eight hundred difficult slokas which are popularly known as ‘Grandh Grandhi’ (Grandhi means a knot)’.\nThey, thus, completed compiling Mahabharata in around three years’ time.\nMahabharata – how it spread? Janamejaya was a great grandson of Arjuna (Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna. His son was Parīkṣit and Parīkṣit’s son was Janamejaya). When Janamejaya ascended the throne, he was minor boy, and he was not aware of the story of his great grandfathers. He was performing Sarpa yāgaṃ (a sacrifice to annihilate the entire race of snakes). A rishi by name Asthika influenced the king and thus the yāgaṃ came to an end. Vedavyasa came to the court of Janamejaya and upon the request of the later, deputed his disciple Vaiśaṃpāyana to narrate the entire story to the king in his court.\nUgrasrava concluded his narration and said to Saunaka, ‘Hi Rishi! I was present in the court of Janamejaya when the Mahabharata narration took place. With all supporting upākhyānās (stories not directly connected main storyline) the Mahabharata is of one lakh slokas. Now I can narrate the whole story which I had heard from Vaiśaṃpāyana.\nThe rishis were happy and sat around the sūta for hearing Mahabharata.\nPoints to Ponder The purpose of writing Mahabharata by Vedavyasa is to spread the message of Vedas to common people (वेदोपबृंहणार्थाय- vedopabṛṃhaṇārthāya). Vedas, it is said, are like commandments of a king – like ‘satyam vada’, ‘dharmam chara’ etc. The depth of the dictums may be understood by the enlightened persons. To make them understand for common people it is necessary to weave a story, for example, the story of Harischandra, Nala, or Sibi. Mahabharata and its stories are case studies to understand the nuances of dharma. Hence it is called Panchama Veda or fifth Veda (the other four being Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda \u0026amp; Adharvana Veda). Mahabharata has been narrated by Ugrasrava, a sūta by caste and it was listened by a rishi and his ten thousand students. A sūta is from the progeny of chariot makers. In Mahabharata times the intellect and the wisdom of the person decided his social status and there was no hesitation for rishis to listen to his narrative. It was an egalitarian society. The Kulapati concept was very prominent in Bharat in ancient times. It is like a present-day university where the pupils congregate to study different fields of study. The calling of the present-day vice chancellor as Kulapati is thus an apt translation of the word. Mahabharata is a vast book with eighteen Parvas. It is an elaborate narration of all fields of knowledge of its time. Vedavyasa visualised it and pronounced famously – ” यदिहास्ति तदन्यत्र यन्नेहास्ति न तत् क्वचित् “- yadihāsti tadanyatra yannehāsti na tat kvacit”. It means whatever here is there anywhere; and what is not here is nowhere. In Mahabharata we find the famous scripture Bhagavad Gita. We also find Vidura Niti, Vishnu Sahasranama, Yaksha Prasnas, and a vast number of anecdotes depicting raj niti, dharma, ethics and moral principles.\nImage Courtesy: https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3af1a26c7f453374ed0512f8bd326bf1-pjlq\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/story-1-the-origin-emergence-of-mahabharatha/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSaunaka Maharshi was a kulapati (currently, the word is loosely translated as the Chancellor of a University) and he was having more than ten thousand students in his āśramaṃ at Naimiśāraṇya.
