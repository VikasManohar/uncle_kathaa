      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;vedavyasa-mahabharatam--the-story-the-ethics-morals--the-traditions&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Vedavyasa Mahabharatam – the story, the ethics, morals &amp;amp; the traditions)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interestingly, the first and the last story of Mahabharata is that of a dog.

Satra yāgaṃ was supposed to &lt;strong&gt;benefit the humanity&lt;/strong&gt; at large and the king was interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
